# Fix Dynatrace style guide violations

Applies automatic corrections to documentation files based on violations
reported by `dt-style-checker`. Only performs safe, mechanical fixes — anything
ambiguous is skipped and reported back for human review.

## Inputs

The caller provides:

```yaml
violations: [<array of dt-style-checker violation records>]
files:      [<absolute paths of files to fix>]
```

Each violation record follows the `dt-style-checker` schema:

```yaml
file:       <absolute path>
line:       <line number>
rule:       <rule identifier>
severity:   BLOCKER | MAJOR | MINOR | NIT
message:    <description>
suggestion: <proposed fix>
```

## Fixable categories

The following violation categories can be auto-fixed with high confidence:

| Rule prefix | Fix type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `DT.Terminology.WrongProductName` | Direct replacement | "Dynatrace OneAgent" → "OneAgent" |
| `DT.Terminology.DeprecatedTerm` | Direct replacement | "plugin" → "extension" |
| `DT.WordList.BannedWord` | Direct replacement | "blacklist" → "blocklist" |
| `DT.WordList.BritishSpelling` | Direct replacement | "behaviour" → "behavior" |
| `DT.WordList.WrongCompound` | Direct replacement | "log-in" (noun) → "login" |
| `DT.Accessibility.AbleistTerm` | Direct replacement | "crazy" → "unexpected" |
| `DT.Accessibility.RacistTerm` | Direct replacement | "master" (tech) → "primary" |
| `DT.Grammar.BannedContraction` | Expansion | "it'll" → "it will" |
| `DT.Formatting.NumberSpelling` | Numeral/word swap | "3 options" → "three options" |
| `DT.UI.ClickInsteadOfSelect` | Direct replacement | "click" → "select" |
| `DT.UI.NavigateInsteadOfGoTo` | Direct replacement | "navigate to" → "go to" |
| `DT.UI.LogInInsteadOfSignIn` | Direct replacement | "log in" → "sign in" |

## Unfixable categories (skip these)

| Rule prefix | Why it's skipped |
|---|---|
| `DT.VoiceTone.PassiveVoice` | Rewriting passive → active changes sentence structure; needs human judgment |
| `DT.VoiceTone.HedgeWord` | Removing hedge words may change the intended meaning |
| `DT.VoiceTone.Patronising` | Context-dependent — "just" and "simply" have valid uses |
| `DT.Formatting.TitleCase` | Heading rewrites may change link anchors and cross-references |
| `DT.Formatting.GerundHeading` | Same — heading text changes affect navigation and linking |
| `DT.Formatting.SerialComma` | Inserting commas in complex lists can introduce ambiguity |
| `DT.Terminology.RegisteredTrademark` | Adding ® symbols requires knowing which is the "first mention" in context |

## Procedure

### 1. Group violations by file

Group the input violations by `file`. Process one file at a time.

### 2. Separate fixable from unfixable

For each file, split violations into:
- **fixable**: rule prefix is in the fixable categories table above AND the
  `suggestion` field provides a clear replacement.
- **unfixable**: everything else.

### 3. Apply fixes (per file)

For each fixable violation, in **reverse line order** (bottom-up, so line numbers
stay valid):

1. Read the line at the specified line number.
2. Verify the violation text actually appears on that line. If it doesn't
   (line number was approximate), search nearby lines (±3). If still not found,
   skip this violation and add to the unfixable list with reason "text not found
   at reported line."
3. Apply the replacement using the edit tool. Use enough surrounding context to
   ensure a unique match.
4. Record what was changed.

### 4. Context-aware safety checks

Before applying any replacement, verify:
- The text is NOT inside a code block (`` ` `` or ```` ``` ````). Skip if it is.
- The text is NOT inside a URL or link target `[...](<here>)`. Skip if it is.
- The text is NOT inside a YAML frontmatter block (`---`). Skip if it is.
- The text is NOT part of a third-party product name. Skip if it is.
- The replacement doesn't create a grammatically broken sentence. If unsure, skip.

### 5. Report

Output a structured summary:

```yaml
status: FIXES_APPLIED | NO_FIXABLE_VIOLATIONS | ERROR
total_violations: <count from input>
fixed: <count of successfully applied fixes>
skipped: <count of unfixable + failed fixes>
files_modified: [<list of modified file paths>]

fixes_applied:
  - file: <path>
    line: <line number>
    rule: <rule>
    original: "<original text>"
    replacement: "<new text>"

fixes_skipped:
  - file: <path>
    line: <line number>
    rule: <rule>
    reason: "<why it was skipped>"
    message: "<original violation message>"
    suggestion: "<original suggestion — apply manually>"
```

## Hard rules

- **NEVER fix violations in code blocks, URLs, frontmatter, or third-party names.**
- **NEVER change heading text** — even for "simple" replacements. Heading changes
  can break links, anchors, and navigation. Report as unfixable with reason
  "heading text — may break cross-references."
- **NEVER add or remove lines.** Only modify existing text on existing lines.
  This preserves line numbers for subsequent review.
- **Apply fixes bottom-up** (highest line number first) so earlier line numbers
  remain valid.
- **Verify before replacing.** If the expected text isn't at the reported line,
  don't guess — skip it.
- **Be conservative.** When in doubt, skip. A missed fix is better than a
  broken document.
- **Preserve surrounding whitespace and formatting.** Don't reindent, rewrap,
  or reformat lines you're fixing.
