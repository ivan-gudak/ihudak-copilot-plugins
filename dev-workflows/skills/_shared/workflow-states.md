# Workflow states (embedded — shared reference)

Maps each Jira **workflow status** on the VI and Epic ladders to (a) its owning role,
(b) the pipeline command that drives the transition into it, and (c) the **expected artifacts**
that should exist at that status. This is the rubric `readiness-reviewer` applies and the
source for the readiness verdict; it also feeds the PM/PA/PE/Team workflow graph.

Jira is the **source of truth** for status (imported into `jira-products/`, emitted by `jira-reader`
as `value_increment.status` + `linked_items[].status`). This reference NEVER stores status —
it only interprets it.

## VI status ladder

`Open → Problem Stated → Use cases defined → Ready for Implementation → Implementation → Release Preparation → Post GA`

| Status | Role | Transition command | Expected artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open | PM | — | VI stub |
| Problem Stated | PM | idea:, create-vi: | VI with Problem/Goal |
| Use cases defined | PM | create-vi: | VI with user stories / use cases |
| Ready for Implementation | PE→Team | epics:, specify:, design: | Epics defined; each in-scope Epic Refined+ with specification.md AND design.md; coverage complete; ARD (if any) respected; no cross-artifact contradictions |
| Implementation | Team | implement: | code in progress (past the readiness gate) |
| Release Preparation | Team/PM | document:, release-notes: | docs + release notes |
| Post GA | PM | — | shipped |

## Epic status ladder

`Open → In Preparation → Refined → In Progress → In Review → Closed`

| Status | Role | Transition command | Expected artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open | PE | epics: | Epic draft |
| In Preparation | PE | specify: | specification.md being authored |
| Refined | PE→Team | specify:, design: | specification.md AND design.md present; coverage complete; ARD (if any) respected — **the Epic-level readiness gate** |
| In Progress | Team | implement: | code in progress (past the gate) |
| In Review | Team | implement: | PRs in review (past the gate) |
| Closed | Team | — | merged/done |

> When the PE has pre-created empty Epic shells in Jira (one per team), `epics: <VI>` detects and **refines** them in place — partitioning the VI scope across teams — instead of generating net-new Epics. Same `Open → Epic draft` transition; the refined drafts are keyed `<EPIC-KEY>.md` and carry a `**Team:**` line.

## Readiness targets (for `ready:`)

- **VI** — "ready for AI-driven development" = the artifacts support the transition into **Ready for Implementation**.
- **Epic** — = the artifacts support the transition into **Refined** (spec **and** design present). **In Progress / In Review / Closed** are *past* the gate — `ready:` reports the gate is moot.

The rubric is advisory: an org may skip an optional artifact (e.g. no ARD) — that downgrades to a MINOR finding, never a hard block on its own.
