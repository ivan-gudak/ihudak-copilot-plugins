# Architecture Requirements/Decision Document (ARD) format (embedded authority)

The canonical structure and rules for an ARD authored by `create-ard:`. `ard-reviewer` reviews against
this file. The ARD is **architecture** — invariants, grounded as-is findings, and cross-cutting
decisions — NOT product requirements (that is the VI) and NOT a per-Epic implementation plan (that is
`design:`). One shape; **depth scales with altitude**: a VI-level ARD stays at invariants + frame; an
Epic-level ARD goes deeper on that Epic's repos/areas.

## Altitude & scope

- **VI-level** (`create-ard: <VI-KEY>`) — cross-cutting invariants + broad-but-shallow grounding across the affected repos.
- **Epic-level** (`create-ard: <VI-KEY> <Epic-KEY>`) — deeper grounding on the Epic's repos/areas; **inherits the VI-level ARD's `AD-N` read-only** and must not contradict them.
- **Per-area** — a big Epic spanning separable areas in one repo (e.g. backend `server/` + frontend `ui/`) may split into `<EPIC>-<area>_ARD.md` (grill-decided).

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: <VI or Epic title> — ARD
scope: vi | epic
vi: <VI-KEY>
epic: <EPIC-KEY | null>
area: <name | null>
status: draft | reviewed
grounded_repos:
  - <repo-slug @ absolute path>
inherits: <path to <VI>_ARD.md | null>
derived_from: <path to <VI>_ValueIncrement.md>
---
```

## Sections

- `## Context` — the problem/goal frame from the VI (Epic-level adds the Epic's scope).
- `## Grounding findings (architecture as-is)` — what exists today, each claim citing a real `file:line` in a `grounded_repos` entry. An unmounted/descoped repo appears only under Open questions — NEVER as an invented "as-is" claim.
- `## Architecture decisions` — `### [AD-N]: <title>`, each with **Binds:** (what it constrains) · **Prevents:** (the divergence it stops) · **Rule:** (a single testable statement). Epic-level lists inherited VI-level ADs read-only under "Inherited invariants".
- `## Cross-repo / component approach` — the Capability→Architecture map (which capability lands in which repo/component).
- `## Stack & invariants` — pinned versions / conventions that must hold.
- `## Edge cases & risks`.
- `## Open questions` — incl. ungrounded/descoped repos.
- `## Deferred` — VI-level → per-Epic `create-ard:` / `design:`; Epic-level → `design:` / `implement:`.

## Quality rules

- Every "as-is" claim cites a grounded `file:line`; no fabricated/uncited architecture.
- `AD-N` are **testable** and non-overlapping (Binds/Prevents/Rule each populated).
- **VI-level carries NO per-repo detailed solutions** — that is `design:`'s job.
- An Epic-level ARD may go deeper but stays architecture, not an implementation plan.
- Grounding is **architect-driven** (repos confirmed by the architect), never derived from PRs (which do not exist at ARD time).
