# Model Routing by Task Complexity (Shared Policy)

This document is the **single source of truth** for how the dev-workflows
orchestrators classify tasks and route them to the appropriate model. Every
pipeline orchestrator — `implement:`, `vuln:`, `upgrade:`, `document:`, `epics:`,
`release-notes:`, `docs-profile:`, `idea:`, `create-vi:`, `create-ard:`,
`specify:`, `design:`, `ready:` — and their sub-agents MUST load and follow this
policy before doing any planning, implementation, review, or authoring work.

Standalone review orchestrators (`api-guideline-reviewer:`, `guideline-reviewer:`)
and the utility surfaces (`feedback:`, `prompt:`, `prompt-brainstorm:`,
`prompt-grill-me:`) are exempt — they do not classify complexity or route models.

---

## 1. Complexity Classes

Every task MUST be classified into exactly one of:

| Class         | Plain meaning                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SIMPLE`      | Trivial, mechanical, low blast radius (typo, comment, single-line tweak).     |
| `MODERATE`    | Localized feature/fix in 1–3 files, well-understood, no security implications.|
| `SIGNIFICANT` | Multi-file or cross-cutting, non-trivial design, real correctness risk.       |
| `HIGH-RISK`   | Security-, data-, or contract-sensitive; mistakes cause outages or breaches.  |

### 1.1 Classify as `SIGNIFICANT` or `HIGH-RISK` if **any** of the following apply

- Major framework or library upgrade (any **major** version bump, e.g. Spring Boot 2→3, React 17→18, Java 11→21).
- Vulnerability fix that requires a **major** dependency version bump or **source-code changes** in the repo (API renames, signature changes, deprecation removals, behaviour adaptations). See the "Vulnerability-fix exception" below — a CVE's category alone (RCE, deserialization, auth bypass, etc.) does **not** force this class regardless of which orchestrator (`vuln:`, `implement:`, `upgrade:`) is invoking the rubric; what matters is the size of the actual fix.
- Touches authentication, authorization, sessions, tokens, OAuth/OIDC, JWT, cookies, CSRF, CORS, or permissions.
- Touches database schema, migrations, or data integrity (DDL, foreign keys, indexes, backfills).
- Public API or wire-protocol contract changes (REST/GraphQL/gRPC routes, request/response shape, event schemas, SDK signatures).
- Broad refactoring across multiple modules.
- Concurrency, caching, transactions, locking, retries, idempotency, async/queue processing.
- Payment, billing, audit, compliance, PII, or other security-sensitive logic.
- Changes touching **more than 3–5 non-test files**.
- **Multi-source input** — `implement:` was given more than one code repository, or any directory input (an exported Jira ticket folder, or a spec/design folder). Large multi-source briefs are cross-cutting by nature; this floors the task at `SIGNIFICANT`. See §8 for the fan-out scan this triggers. The floor is overridable at plan approval if the user judges the work genuinely smaller than its input footprint.
- Unclear requirements, large unknowns, or otherwise high blast radius.

`HIGH-RISK` is the same list with an additional severity multiplier — pick it
when the change is **production-critical, security-critical, or data-irreversible**
(e.g. an auth bypass CVE in a public service; a destructive DB migration).

### 1.2 Classify as `MODERATE` when

- 1–3 files; well-scoped feature, bugfix, or refactor; no items from §1.1 apply.

### 1.3 Classify as `SIMPLE` when

- Single trivial edit (typo, formatting, log message, comment, dead-code removal)
  with no behavioural impact.

> **When in doubt, escalate one level.** Misclassifying upward is cheap; the
> only cost is one extra strong-model call. Misclassifying downward can ship bugs.

> **Vulnerability-fix exception — classify by fix size, not CVE category.**
> Two distinct rules apply here:
>
> **(a) Universal — CVE category never forces SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK.** A
> CVE's category (RCE, deserialization, auth bypass, etc.) drives *attention*
> but does **not** by itself force a SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK class, regardless
> of which orchestrator (`vuln:`, `implement:`, `upgrade:`) is invoking the
> rubric. Most CVEs are remediated by a patch or minor dependency bump with
> no source-code changes — those are MODERATE.
>
> **(b) Per-CVE size analysis — `vuln:` orchestrator only.** Only `vuln:`
> performs per-CVE fix-size analysis. In `vuln:`, escalate to SIGNIFICANT
> when the fix requires a major version bump or actual code changes in the
> repo (API renames, signature changes, deprecation removals, behaviour
> adaptations). Escalate to HIGH-RISK when a major bump targets a
> security-critical library (auth/authn frameworks, crypto, deserializers,
> JWT, OAuth, session libs). See `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/fix-vuln/SKILL.md`
> "Step 0 — Classify & Route" for the full vulnerability rubric.
>
> **For `implement:` and `upgrade:` orchestrators**, the standard rubric in §1.1
> applies — there is no per-CVE size analysis available at classification
> time. If the user wants CVE-aware sizing, route the work through `vuln:`.

---

## 2. Strong (reasoning) tier — "strongest available reasoning model"

Reasoning-heavy work (planning critique, code review, product-doc review, Epic
review, engineering-design review, synthesis) runs on the **strong tier**.

The strong tier is a **peer set**, not a single vendor ladder:

- `claude-opus-4.8`
- `claude-opus-4.7`
- `claude-opus-4.6`
- `gpt-5.5`

These four are **first-class peers**. GPT-5.5 is a strong reasoning model in its
own right — it is **not** a degraded fallback, and choosing it is never announced
as a downgrade. (GPT models were unavailable in Claude Code, so the original
policy was Opus-only; on Copilot CLI, GPT-5.5 is a co-equal strong option.)

**Selection rule:**

1. Prefer the model the **orchestrator is already running under** if it is in the
   strong-tier peer set (e.g. an Opus 4.8 session pins gates to Opus 4.8; a
   GPT-5.5 session pins gates to GPT-5.5).
2. Otherwise pick the first available peer in the list order above.

**Further fallbacks** (only if no strong-tier peer is available — announce the
degradation in the routing record and final report):

5. `claude-opus-4.5`
6. `claude-sonnet-4.6`
7. `claude-sonnet-4.5`
8. `gpt-5.4`
9. `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`

`gemini-3.1-pro-preview` is the floor; if no model in the list is available,
abort the SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK gates and ask the user how to proceed rather than
silently downgrading.

The list of available models can be inspected from the `task` tool's `model`
parameter documentation. The "currently selected model" is whatever the
orchestrator itself is running under (see `~/.copilot/settings.json` → `model`).
Sub-agents inherit it unless the orchestrator explicitly overrides via the
`task` tool's `model` argument.

---

## 2.1 Detection ("mid-tier / throughput") chain

Some steps are deliberately **not** reasoning-heavy — mechanical detection, repo
scanning, transcription, formatting, mechanical fixes. Pin these to the detection
chain via the `task` tool's `model:` override; do **not** let them inherit the
session model (a strong-tier session would otherwise run "cheap" steps on an
expensive model, defeating the point).

Use the first available:

1. `claude-sonnet-4.6`
2. `claude-sonnet-4.5`
3. `gpt-5.4` (further fallback — note the degradation in the report)

If none is available, fall back to the session model and announce it. Record the
chosen model as `detection_model:` in the `model_routing` block.

---

## 3. Routing rules

### 3.1 SIMPLE / MODERATE

- Continue with the currently selected model.
- Do **not** add mandatory strong-tier gate steps.
- Proceed with normal planning, implementation, testing, and fixes.
- Skip the dedicated strong-tier code review (the standard `risk-planner` consult
  — when called — uses the workflow's default model selection).

### 3.2 SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK — mandatory sequence

The orchestrator MUST execute these steps in order:

1. **Classify** the task and record the decision (see §4).
2. **Plan with the strong tier.** Delegate planning (or planning critique) to a
   sub-agent running on the strongest available reasoning model from §2. See §5
   for the exact `task` invocation pattern.
3. **Implement** with the currently selected model **or** the detection chain
   (fine for raw coding throughput; the strong tier is not required here).
   Sub-agents that do the actual file edits inherit the orchestrator's model
   unless overridden.
4. **Strong-tier code review** of the completed implementation. This is a
   dedicated `code-review` sub-agent invocation pinned to the §2 strong tier. It
   MUST cover every item in the §6 checklist. Tests MUST NOT be run until this
   review completes.
5. **Run tests** (build + test suite per the executor / fixer skill).
6. **Apply review fixes** — fixes flagged by the review may be implemented by the
   currently selected model **or** the detection chain (no strong tier required
   for the fix edits themselves).
7. **Re-run tests** if any review fixes were applied.
8. **Final summary** — include the classification, the models used at each step
   (or the fallback notice), and a one-line outcome per checklist item from §6.

> **Do not use the strong tier for routine implementation steps unless the user
> explicitly requested it.** The strong tier is reserved for planning and the
> dedicated review.

---

## 4. The `model_routing` handoff block

Every orchestrator MUST record its routing decision and pass it to every
sub-agent it invokes. Format:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: SIMPLE | MODERATE | SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK
  reason: <one-line justification citing the §1 trigger that applied>
  current_model: <e.g. claude-opus-4.8 or gpt-5.5>   # the model the orchestrator is running
  planning_model: <e.g. claude-opus-4.8>     # strong tier; only set for SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK
  review_model:   <e.g. claude-opus-4.8>     # strong tier; only set for SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK
  implementation_model: <e.g. claude-sonnet-4.6 or current_model>
  detection_model: <e.g. claude-sonnet-4.6>  # mid-tier steps (§2.1); never the session model
  fixes_model:    <same as implementation_model>
  strong_available: true | false             # true if any §2 peer (Opus 4.8/4.7/4.6 or GPT-5.5) is available
  gate_tests_on_review: true | false   # optional; default false. Only meaningful for SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK.
                                       # When true, the executor/fixer sub-agent stops after the build,
                                       # returns status: AWAITING_REVIEW, and waits for a follow-up call
                                       # with phase: verify-resume to run tests / commit / PR.
  notes: <optional — e.g. "Opus unavailable; ran gates on gpt-5.5 (peer, not a downgrade)">
```

The `phase` field used to resume an executor/fixer after the strong-tier review
is completed is **`verify-resume`** for both `upgrade-executor` and `vuln-fixer`
(harmonised). The executor/fixer must accept this value and run all remaining
steps (verify tests; for the fixer also commit + PR).

For SIMPLE/MODERATE the `planning_model` and `review_model` fields MAY be omitted
or set to `current_model`.

Sub-agents that receive a `model_routing` block:

- `upgrade-planner`, `vuln-research`: use the `planning_model` if present
  (orchestrator should invoke them with the corresponding `task` `model:` arg).
- `upgrade-executor`, `vuln-fixer`: **do not run tests** until the orchestrator
  has confirmed the strong-tier review has completed (when classification is
  SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK). The orchestrator achieves this by invoking the
  executor/fixer **without** the build+test phase first (apply changes only),
  then running the review, then invoking the executor/fixer again to run tests.
  Equivalently, the orchestrator may invoke a single combined call with a
  `gate_tests_on_review: true` flag — both styles are acceptable.
- `risk-planner`, `code-review`, `epic-reviewer`, `doc-reviewer`, `vi-reviewer`,
  `ard-reviewer`, `spec-reviewer`, `design-reviewer`, `readiness-reviewer`: the
  orchestrator pins these to the §2 strong tier via the `task` tool's `model:`
  argument. They receive the `model_routing` block for context and reporting.
- `jira-reader`, `code-scanner`, `diff-summarizer`, `doc-location-finder`,
  `docs-style-checker`, `doc-fixer`: pinned to the §2.1 detection chain.
- `doc-planner`, `doc-writer`, `epic-writer`, `release-notes-writer`: strong tier
  for SIGNIFICANT/judgment authoring; detection chain for MODERATE (see §9).
- `test-baseliner`, `test-writer`, `impl-maintenance`: receive the block for
  reporting only; behaviour is unchanged.

---

## 5. Delegating to a model via the `task` tool

The CLI's `task` tool accepts an explicit `model:` override. Use it like this:

```
task(
  agent_type: "dev-workflows:risk-planner" | "dev-workflows:code-review" | "general-purpose",
  model:      "claude-opus-4.8",   # or the highest available strong-tier peer per §2
  prompt:     "<full self-contained context — sub-agent has no memory>",
  description:"Strong-tier planning critique" | "Strong-tier code review",
  mode:       "sync"               # always sync for plan/review gates
)
```

- For **planning** on SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK tasks, prefer `agent_type: "dev-workflows:risk-planner"`
  with the strong tier, asking it to critique the proposed plan.
- For **post-implementation review** on SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK tasks, use
  `agent_type: "dev-workflows:code-review"` with the strong tier, passing the diff and §6 checklist.
- If `dev-workflows:code-review` is unavailable in the environment, fall back to
  `agent_type: "general-purpose"` with the same strong-tier model and the explicit
  §6 checklist embedded in the prompt.

---

## 6. Mandatory strong-tier code-review checklist (SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK)

The post-implementation review MUST explicitly comment on each of:

1. **Correctness** — does the change actually do what was planned, including all
   listed acceptance criteria and edge cases?
2. **Security impact** — new attack surface, authn/authz changes, secret
   handling, input validation, deserialization, injection vectors, supply chain.
3. **Architectural consistency** — boundaries respected, abstractions intact,
   no leaking concerns, idiomatic for the codebase.
4. **Missed edge cases** — empty/null/zero/negative/very-large inputs, partial
   failures, concurrent access, time-zone / DST / locale, off-by-one, retries.
5. **Migration risks** — schema changes, data backfills, feature flags, ordering
   between deploy and migration, forward/backward compatibility windows.
6. **Dependency risks** — new transitive deps, license changes, abandoned
   packages, known CVEs in the new versions, lockfile drift.
7. **Test adequacy** — does the test suite actually cover the new behaviour?
   Are negative tests and boundary tests present? Are tests deterministic?
8. **Rollback considerations** — how is this change reverted? Are migrations
   reversible? Is there a feature flag? What is the worst-case incident playbook?

The review output MUST include a verdict per item: `OK` / `CONCERN` / `BLOCKER`,
plus a free-text comment for any non-`OK` finding. The orchestrator MUST address
every `BLOCKER` (and document the disposition of each `CONCERN`) before
proceeding to tests.

---

## 7. Reporting

The orchestrator's final report MUST include a `### Model Routing` section:

```
### Model Routing
- Classification: <class>
- Reason: <trigger>
- Planning model: <model>
- Implementation model: <model>
- Review model: <model>  (or "n/a — SIMPLE/MODERATE")
- Strong-tier checklist verdicts:
  - Correctness: OK | CONCERN | BLOCKER
  - Security: ...
  - Architecture: ...
  - Edge cases: ...
  - Migration: ...
  - Dependencies: ...
  - Tests: ...
  - Rollback: ...
- Notes: <degradation, fallbacks, deferred items>
```

For SIMPLE/MODERATE tasks the verdict list MAY be omitted; the classification
and reason are still required.

---

## 8. Large-input scan fan-out

When a scanning step must digest more than a single working tree, a single
explorer subagent on a weak session model comprehends it poorly. This section
is the shared policy for that case. It is consulted by `implement:` and
generalizes the pattern `epics:` already uses.

### 8.1 Trigger (input shape, not measured volume)

Fan out when **any** of these structural facts hold for the invocation:

- more than one code repository is referenced;
- an exported Jira ticket folder is supplied;
- a spec/design folder is supplied.

Counting files or bytes is explicitly **not** used — the trigger is the shape
of the input, which is cheap to detect and easy to explain. A single repo with
inline/`@file` text only does **not** trigger fan-out; the caller keeps its
normal single-explorer path.

### 8.2 The fan-out pattern

1. `jira-reader` reads each ticket folder (read-only) → themes, PR references
   (identifiers only), linked items.
2. Spec/design folders are read inline and folded into the themes.
3. `code-scanner` is fanned out **one instance per repository, in a single
   response, capped at 4 concurrent**. Each instance receives the themes and
   its own repo path; it returns capabilities, gaps, and relevant files.
4. The orchestrator synthesizes the `jira-reader` output, all scanner reports,
   and the spec into one codebase summary that feeds the strong-tier planner.

### 8.3 Model routing inside the fan-out

- `jira-reader` and `code-scanner` are **pinned to the §2.1 detection chain**
  via the `task` tool `model:` override — the same rule as every other mechanical
  step (§2.1, §9.1). Scanning is mechanical filesystem work; it must not inherit
  the session model (a strong-tier session would otherwise burn an expensive
  model on a cheap step), and its tier must not depend on which model the session
  happens to run under.
- Because the trigger floors the task at `SIGNIFICANT` (§1.1), synthesis and
  planning run on the strongest available reasoning model via `risk-planner`
  (§2 chain). That is where reasoning power is applied — the mechanical scan
  that feeds it does not need it.
- **Optional escalation:** if a single repo slice is itself oversized for the
  detection tier to comprehend, the orchestrator MAY pin that one `code-scanner`
  to the strong tier via the `task` tool `model:` override. This is a size-driven,
  judgment-based exception — not session-driven.

### 8.4 Honesty

A referenced directory that is missing, or is neither a recognized folder type
nor a git repository, MUST be surfaced to the user — never silently skipped
(mirrors the `REFRESH_BLOCKED` honesty rule used by the Jira-driven flows).

---

## 9. Per-step routing for multi-phase authoring pipelines

The Jira-driven authoring pipelines (`document:` and `epics:`) run a long
sequence of phases — some judgment-heavy, some mechanical. They MUST NOT let
every step inherit the session model. Apply this policy, resolving each model
against the §2 (strong) and §2.1 (detection) chains.

### 9.1 Principle

- **Judgment-heavy authoring / synthesis** steps run on the §2 strong chain —
  escalate to the strong tier even when the session is a detection-tier model.
- **Mechanical detection / throughput / fix** steps run on the §2.1 detection
  chain — de-escalate off the session model even when the session is strong-tier
  (otherwise a strong-tier session burns an expensive model on cheap work).
- **Orchestrator-executed** judgment steps — the inline prose writing and the
  interactive gates, plus the orchestration itself — run on the session model
  and CANNOT be overridden from inside a running command. Handle them with an
  **advisory** (recommend relaunching on the §2 chain), never an override. This
  advisory applies when the task is SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK; for SIMPLE/MODERATE the
  writer runs on its detection pin without a relaunch advisory (per §3.1).

### 9.2 Role → chain map

| Role | Chain |
|------|-------|
| Synthesis / planner (e.g. `doc-planner`) | §2 strong |
| Reader / summarizer / locator / style-checker / fixer / maintenance (`jira-reader`, `diff-summarizer`, `doc-location-finder`, `docs-style-checker`, `doc-fixer`, maintenance agents) | §2.1 detection |
| Domain reviewer (`doc-reviewer`, `epic-reviewer`) | §2 strong — usually already frontmatter-pinned; the orchestrator records it and adds **no** override |
| Delegated writer (`doc-writer` / `epic-writer`) | §2 strong for SIGNIFICANT/judgment writing; §2.1 detection for MODERATE writing |
| Coordination + interactive gates (the orchestrator itself) | session model; narrowed-window advisory for large non-strong-tier runs (§9.1) |

### 9.3 No-strong-tier degradation

When no strong-tier peer is available (per §2), run the reasoning / review roles
on the next available fallback, **skip** the relaunch advisory (there is nothing
to relaunch onto), and announce the degradation in the `model_routing` record and
the final report — the same rule as §2.

### 9.4 One rule across commands (`implement:` included)

Routing is by **step nature**, not by pipeline or session: `jira-reader` and
`code-scanner` are mechanical, so they run on the §2.1 detection chain in
**every** command — `implement:`'s fan-out (§8.3), `epics:`, and `document:`
alike. There is no "inherit the session model" for scanning and no per-command
exception. A step's downstream consumer does not change its tier: a mechanical
scan that feeds a strong-tier synthesis (e.g. `implement:`'s `risk-planner`) still
runs on the detection chain — the reasoning power is applied in the synthesis
step, not the scan. The only carve-out is size-driven, not session-driven:
escalate a single oversized repo slice's `code-scanner` to the strong tier (§8.3).
