# docs-profile schema

`docs-profile:` writes this file to **`.dev-workflows/docs-profile.yml`** in
the target docs repo. `document:` reads it. `changelog` and `owners` are
intentionally absent — they are owned by the `dynatrace-docs-frontmatter` skill.

  policy: "CDN-hosted; the user uploads to CDN and supplies links; docs reference the URLs; never commit binaries"
prerequisites:
  - "a dev server may need a working .docstack toolchain (e.g. an axios>=1.16 shim) before `*:start` boots"
```

## Field rules
- `spaces[]` is required and non-empty. A single-space repo has one entry and omits `cross_space_override`.
- `dev_servers.concurrent: false` means the consumer must start servers sequentially.
- `dev_servers.readiness_timeout_seconds` is optional (default 120) — how many seconds Phase 6.5 polls a booted server for readiness before falling back to the manual table.
- `commit_convention` is optional — the squash commit-message format Phase 8.5 uses. When absent, the consumer infers it from recent `git log` / `CONTRIBUTING`, else falls back to `<JIRA_KEY> <summary>`.
- `cross_space_override` and `shared_registries` are present only when detected (multi-space / docstack repos).
- `frontmatter.*` are pointers; never copy the rules here.
