# impl-maintenance Handoff Format

## Input (impl orchestrator → impl-maintenance)

The caller passes a **compact session handoff**:

```markdown
Session handoff:
- Command run: implement:
- What was done: [1-paragraph summary — classification, component/CVE/task, scope]
- Key events: [BLOCK reviews, test regressions, missing reference docs, workarounds needed, ambiguities that required user clarification, surprising compatibility issues — or "none"]
- Workarounds used: [manual steps the workflow could not automate — or "none"]
- Review verdict: [PASS | PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS | BLOCK (+ what the BLOCK was) | N/A]
- Test result: [passed | regressions | not run]
- Project root: [absolute path]
```

`Command run` is one of `implement:`, `document:` (direct mode), `document:`
(Jira mode), `epics:`, `vuln:`, `upgrade:`, `design:`, `specify:`,
`release-notes:`, `idea:`, `create-vi:`, `create-ard:`, or `ready:` — it
scopes any "Command workflow improvements" suggestions to
the right command. If `Command run` is missing from the handoff, default to
`implement:` (the canonical code workflow) and note the substitution in the
report's `### Session summary` so the caller notices and updates their
invocation.

## Output (impl-maintenance → impl orchestrator)

Return this exact shape (no preamble, no chatter):

```markdown
## Session Learnings

### Session summary
[1–2 sentences on what was done and the overall outcome]

### Key observations
- [What happened / what was unexpected — one bullet per event]
- ...
- _or_ "No notable events — session followed standard workflow"

### Suggested improvements

#### copilot-instructions.md rules
- **Rule**: [proposed rule text, ready to paste]
  **Rationale**: [why this would have helped]
  **Scope**: [project-level .github/copilot-instructions.md | global ~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md]
- ...
- _or_ "No new rules suggested"

#### Hooks
- **Hook**: [name and trigger (e.g. UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse:Bash)]
  **Purpose**: [what it would do]
  **Rationale**: [why this would help]
- ...
- _or_ "No new hooks suggested"

#### Reference docs
- **File**: [path, e.g. ~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/upgrade/compatibility.md]
  **Change**: [what to add or update]
  **Rationale**: [what was missing that caused the workaround or ambiguity]
- ...
- _or_ "No reference doc gaps found"

#### New agents / skills
- **Agent**: [proposed name and one-line description]
  **Purpose**: [what task it would handle; why it should be reusable]
  **Suggested tools**: [list]
- ...
- _or_ "No new agents suggested"

#### Command workflow improvements
- **Command**: [implement: | document: (direct mode) | document: (Jira mode) | epics: | vuln: | upgrade: | design: | specify: | release-notes: | idea: | create-vi: | create-ard: | ready:]
  **Section**: [Phase / step reference]
  **Change**: [what to change and why]
- ...
- _or_ "No command improvements suggested"

### Priority
[HIGH — multiple observations point to the same gap | MEDIUM — single clear gap | LOW — minor polish only]
```

This agent is suggest-only — it never writes, edits, or creates a file. The caller (the invoking command) is responsible for acting on any of the suggestions above.
