# jira-reader Handoff Format

## Input

```yaml
# Form 1 — preferred (from the jira-input-resolution front-end): explicit export root.
jira_export_root: <absolute path to the ticket export dir, e.g. .../jira-products/PRODUCT-14902>
jira_key:         <e.g. JIRA-12345>
depth:            full | vi-plus-epics | vi-only

# Form 2 — legacy (epics:, release-notes:): vault path + key
# (export root is derived as <vault_path>/jira-products/<jira_key>).
vault_path: <absolute path, e.g. /home/user/obsidian-vault>
jira_key:   <e.g. JIRA-12345>
depth:      full | vi-plus-epics | vi-only

model_routing:
  classification: SIGNIFICANT | MODERATE
  reason: <from orchestrator>
  current_model: <model name>
  planning_model: <model name>
  review_model: n/a
  implementation_model: <model name>
  opus_available: true | false
  gate_tests_on_review: false
```

Refuse to run without `depth`, `jira_key`, and at least one of
`{jira_export_root, vault_path}`.

## Status codes

| Status     | Meaning                                                                 |

| `OK`       | Successfully read; `linked_items` and `pull_requests` populated.        |
| `EMPTY`    | Directory found but index file is missing or empty.                     |
| `NOT_FOUND`| The resolved export root does not exist — `<vault_path>/jira-products/<jira_key>/` (Form 2), or the caller-supplied `jira_export_root` (Form 1). |
