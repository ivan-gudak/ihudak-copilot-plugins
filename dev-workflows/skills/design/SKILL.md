Author an engineering design for the Jira item: the argument (text following the `design:` trigger)

`design:` is the **Dev-phase engineering-design** workflow — the design step of the PM→PA→PE→Dev pipeline
(`specify:` → `specification.md`; then `design:` → `design.md`). The developer *takes over* a merged
`specification.md`, grounds in the **fully-mounted** implementation code, and authors a reviewed
engineering `design.md` through a relentless one-question-at-a-time grill that **challenges** the spec
and **designs** the implementation. It gates on the Opus `design-reviewer` and offers to land
`design.md` + the spec's engineering-review edits on the specs repo's main branch (via branch + PR) so
`implement:` can plan and build from it.

Key distinction from `specify:`: `specify:` (PE) *authors* the requirements spec and grounds lightly
(soft repo gate); `design:` (Dev) *challenges* that spec and *designs* the implementation, and must see
**all** implementation repos — its repo gate is **strict** (hard-stop on any unmounted repo).

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve input

1. **Resolve the Jira input via the shared front-end.** Execute
   `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/jira-input-resolution.md` against the argument (text following the `design:` trigger). `design:` is
   **jira-driven only**: expect `mode: jira-driven`. The front-end owns the `$VAULT_PATH` /
   `jira-products` validation, Fallbacks A/B **and D/E**, and the VI-selector (key-or-directory) +
   focus-Epic grammar. Carry forward:
   - `jira_key` — the resolved **top-level** key: the **VI** when a focus Epic is present, or the
     stand-alone top-level item's own key otherwise. Define `<VI>` = `jira_key`.
   - `focus_key` — the **Epic** to design within its VI, or `null` for a bare VI / stand-alone item /
     directory. Define `<EPIC>` = `focus_key` (may be `null`).

   If the front-end returns `mode: direct`, stop with
   `DESIGN_NEEDS_JIRA: design: needs a Jira key (a VI or an Epic) or an imported-Jira directory.` —
   `design:` has no direct-prompt behaviour. **`design:` uses the front-end only to parse the grammar
   and classify the key; it does NOT call `jira-reader` and does NOT read the Jira export for content —
   the requirements source of truth is the merged `specification.md` in the specs repo.**

2. **Resolve `$SPECS_PATH`.** `design:` reads `specification.md` and writes `design.md` under
   `$SPECS_PATH/specifications/`. If `$SPECS_PATH` is unset, stop with a clear error naming `SPECS_PATH`
   (`choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]`).

3. **Map onto the specs repo + require the spec on main.** Derive provisional kebab-case slugs from the
   relevant Jira title(s): `<vslug>` for `<VI>`, and `<eslug>` for `<EPIC>` when `focus_key` is set.
   - **Resolve the VI dir:** `specifications/<VI>-<vslug>/` — honor an existing dir matched by
     key-number (tolerate a stray `-`/`_` after the key and a human-adjusted slug); use the freshly
     derived `<VI>-<vslug>` only if none exists.
   - **Resolve the feature folder + confirm the spec is on main** (the `mgd-specifications` **main**
     branch is the handoff surface — read from a clean main checkout, never a branch), by case:
     - **`focus_key` set** → the per-Epic home `specifications/<VI>-<vslug>/<EPIC>-<eslug>/` (same
       honor-existing tolerance on the `<EPIC>-<eslug>` segment). Require `specification.md` there.
     - **`focus_key` null** → resolved in step 4 (Granularity): either the flat VI dir (stand-alone
       Epic / broad VI spec) or a per-Epic subfolder the picker selects.
   - If the target `specification.md` is not present on main → stop:
     `spec not handed off — run specify: for this item and merge it to the specs repo main first.`

4. **Granularity — the Epic is the unit of work; no fan-out. Progress-aware Epic picker.** One
   `design.md` per invocation. Resolve by `focus_key`:
   - **`focus_key` set** (explicit `<VI> <Epic>` / `<dir> <Epic>`, or a nested-Epic key auto-resolved by
     the front-end) → the Epic is chosen; the feature folder is its per-Epic home. Skip the picker; go
     to step 5.
   - **`focus_key` null** → inspect the resolved VI dir in the specs repo:
     - it holds a **flat `specification.md`** (a stand-alone top-level Epic, or a broad VI-level spec) →
       one design; the feature folder is the VI dir itself. Skip the picker; go to step 5.
     - it holds **Epic subfolders** each with a `specification.md` on main → enumerate those **spec'd**
       Epics (subfolders **without** a merged `specification.md` are not yet designable — exclude them
       and report the excluded count). Then branch on count — this is the reusable **progress-aware
       Epic-picker pattern** in `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/jira-input-resolution.md`
       (§ Progress-aware Epic picker), applied here with `design:`'s own done-predicate and
       **enumerated from the specs repo** (not `jira-reader`):
       - **exactly 1 spec'd Epic** → no picker; auto-select it; re-point the feature folder to its
         per-Epic subfolder; emit a one-line notice.
       - **≥2 spec'd Epics** → render the picker, one `choices` entry per spec'd Epic (its ○/◐/● marker
         + key + title), then `"Other… (describe)"`. Compute each Epic's state from `design:`'s
         **done-predicate** against that Epic's resolved folder:
         - **○ not started** — a `specification.md` exists there but no `design.md` and no
           `_design-session.md` → selectable.
         - **◐ in progress** — a `_design-session.md` exists there but no `design.md` → selectable as a
           resume (per-Epic stage resume then runs in Phase 5 from that `_design-session.md`).
         - **● done** — a `design.md` exists there → shown greyed, **not** default-selectable; selecting
           offers *revise*.
         Default cursor = the first actionable row (in-progress before not-started). On selecting an
         Epic → set `focus_key` = that Epic and re-point the feature folder to its per-Epic subfolder.
     - neither a flat `specification.md` nor any spec'd Epic subfolder → stop
       (`spec not handed off — run specify: first`).

5. **Detect a prior `design:` run.** If a `_design-session.md` exists in the resolved feature folder,
   record that a resume is available — Phase 1 asks resume-vs-fresh. (Distinct from `specify:`'s
   `_session.md`, which may coexist in the same flat folder.)

`design:` is **cwd-agnostic** — it reads/writes an absolute `$SPECS_PATH`-rooted feature folder and
scans repos under `$REPOS_PATH`; cwd need not be inside either.

---

## Phase 1 — Configure

**Rule: Ask, don't guess. This rule is absolute.** Use `choices` arrays; the last choice in every array
MUST be `"Other… (describe)"`.

1. **Feature folder.** Confirm the path resolved in Phase 0:
   `choices: ["Use <feature_folder> (Recommended)", "Use a different path (you'll be prompted)", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`
2. **Resume vs fresh** (only if step 5 found a `_design-session.md`): read it back and summarise which
   stages are settled:
   `choices: ["Resume — skip settled stages (Recommended)", "Start fresh — discard the prior design session", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`
3. **Repo refresh policy** (governs Phase 4's `code-scanner` dispatches):
   `choices: ["fetch + pull default branch (Recommended)", "fetch only", "no refresh", "Other… (describe)"]`
4. **Repos search base (`$REPOS_PATH`).** Read `${REPOS_PATH:-/workspace}` (may be colon-separated):
   `choices: ["Use $REPOS_PATH (default /workspace) (Recommended)", "Use a different path (you'll be prompted)", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Also display (context): resolved feature folder; resolved `<VI>` / `<EPIC>` (or 'none — VI-level');
resolved `$SPECS_PATH`; resolved `$REPOS_PATH`.

---

## Phase 1.5 — Classify + tiered model gate

Load and follow the model-routing policy at
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md`, then classify as
`SIMPLE` / `MODERATE` / `SIGNIFICANT` / `HIGH-RISK`. This single classification scales **grill depth**,
`design.md` **section-inclusion** (per `design-format.md`), and **`design-reviewer` rigor** together.
Resolve per-step routing per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §9:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: <SIMPLE|MODERATE|SIGNIFICANT|HIGH-RISK>
  reason: <one-line>
  current_model: <the model this orchestrator/grill is running under>
  detection_model: <§2.1 detection chain: claude-sonnet-4.6, fallback claude-sonnet-4.5/gpt-5.4>   # code-scanner
  review_model:    <§2 Opus chain>     # design-reviewer (caller-pinned; recorded)
  authoring_model: <= current_model>   # the interactive grill + design.md authoring (session model, not a delegated subagent)
  opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
  notes: <any §2/§2.1 fallback or degradation>
```

The grill + authoring run inline on `current_model` (interactive judgment — not a delegated subagent).

**Tiered model gate (stricter than `implement:` — `design:`'s critical synthesis is inline, not an Opus
subagent):**
- **SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK + `current_model` is not an Opus-tier model → HARD gate.** Stop and require
  relaunching `design:` on Opus (the run is resumable from `_design-session.md`):
  `choices: ["I'll relaunch design: on Opus (Recommended)", "Override — proceed on the current model (logged in the final report)", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`
  Design authoring for risky work must be Opus — the Opus `design-reviewer` reviews, it cannot originate
  good architecture.
- **SIMPLE / MODERATE + not Opus → soft advisory.** Recommend Opus but proceed; record the choice in
  `notes` and the final report.
- **Opus session →** proceed (the intended case).

---

## Phase 2 — Read the spec

Read the resolved `specification.md` **fully** (from the specs repo main). Extract the in-scope items,
user stories (`[Uxx]`), acceptance criteria (`[ACxx]`), and test cases (`[TCxx]`) the design must cover
— this is the traceability baseline for **Requirements coverage** and the raw material the grill
challenges. Note the spec's `Published` flag (governs whether Phase 5 may propose ID changes or must
annotate-only) and any existing `- [ ]` open questions (spec-level; tolerated — the design may resolve
or inherit them). **No Jira re-read** — the spec is the requirements source of truth.

---

## Phase 2.5 — Resolve applicable ARD (optional)

Resolve any ARD for this item by citing `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/ard-resolution.md` with `<VI>`, `<EPIC>` (`focus_key`), and `$SPECS_PATH`. On `status: none`, **skip the rest of this phase and proceed exactly as before** (no ARD in play). On `status: found`, carry the returned `invariants` (VI-level inherited + Epic-level `AD-N`) and `guidance_summary` into Phase 5 — the design is authored **within** them, and a necessary deviation is recorded in a `## ARD deviations` section of `design.md` + as a `- [ ]` open question (never edit the ARD). The `invariants` list is passed to `design-reviewer` in Phase 6 as `applicable_ard`.

---

## Phase 3 — Derive repos + STRICT gate

1. **Auto-derive candidate repos** from the spec's themes / component mentions / any referenced code
   paths. Build the slug→clone map (`epics:`-style): for each top-level dir under each `$REPOS_PATH`
   entry, `timeout 5 git -C <dir> remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null`, strip a trailing `.git`, take the
   URL's last path segment as the slug; skip dirs with no `.git` or a failing/timed-out call.
2. **Confirm the complete set — the developer owns it.** Present the derived candidates and ask the
   developer to confirm the **complete** list of implementation repos this design must span:
   `choices: ["Confirm this set (Recommended)", "Add repos (you'll be prompted)", "Remove repos (you'll be prompted)", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`
3. **Resolve each confirmed repo against the map.** One match → use it. Ambiguous or zero matches
   escalate per the `Repo unresolved (zero matches) — epics:` rule in
   `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/escalation-rules.md`:
   `choices: ["Skip and continue without this repo's scan", "I'll clone it — wait", "Cancel", "Specify a different absolute path for this repo", "Other… (describe)"]`
4. **STRICT mounted gate — hard-stop.** Any repo in the confirmed set that is **not mounted** under
   `$REPOS_PATH` **hard-stops** `design:` (unlike `specify:`'s soft gate): describe the missing
   capability and why the design needs it (you cannot name or link an unmounted repo's code), then:
   `choices: ["I've remounted — re-scan", "Remove this repo from the design's scope (you confirm it's not needed)", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`
   On "remounted", the developer restarts the container with the repo mounted and re-runs `design:`
   (resuming from `_design-session.md`); a design cannot be completed while a confirmed repo is missing
   unless the developer explicitly removes it from scope. Record the confirmed repo set in
   `_design-session.md`.

---

## Phase 4 — Code scan

Spawn `code-scanner` instances in **batches of up to 4 concurrent agents** per Agent message over
**all** confirmed, mounted repos (the scan runs over the full set regardless of classification — only
grill depth / sections / review scale by tier). Wait for each batch before the next.

→ task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:code-scanner", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
  > "Scan this repo for the brief:
  >
  > repo_path:     <resolved absolute path for this repo from Phase 3>
  > repo_url_slug: <repo slug, e.g. "cluster">
  > capability_themes:
  >   [themes derived from the specification]
  > context: |
  >   [3–5 sentences: what the spec requires; what the design must ground — seams, interfaces, gaps]
  > search_hints:
  >   symbols:  [names inferred from the spec, or []]
  >   paths:    [globs inferred from themes, or []]
  >   keywords: [grep keywords from themes]
  > refresh:
  >   switch_to_default_branch: [true if Phase 1 chose 'fetch + pull default branch' or 'fetch only'; false if 'no refresh']
  >   pull: [true only if 'fetch + pull default branch'; false otherwise]"

Handle per-repo status after the batch returns:
- `OK` / `PARTIAL` / `EMPTY` — store the capabilities / seams / interfaces / gaps output; this grounds
  Phase 5's design decisions.
- `REPO_MISSING` — should not occur post-gate; if it does, return to the Phase 3 strict gate for that
  repo.
- `DIRTY_TREE` — escalate per the `Dirty working tree` rule in
  `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/escalation-rules.md`.
- `REFRESH_BLOCKED` — escalate per the `Refresh blocked` rule in
  `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/escalation-rules.md`.

---

## Phase 5 — Grill: challenge + design

**Interview technique (grilling — embedded; no runtime dependency).** Conduct the design as a **relentless** interview per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/grilling-technique.md` — one question at a time, recommend each answer, explore the Phase 4 code scan / spec to self-answer (fact-vs-decision), walk the design tree in dependency order, continue to shared understanding then write the section.

Run **two intertwined tracks**, authoring `design.md` live against
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/design-format.md`, sections scaled by the Phase 1.5 classification:

- **Challenge the spec.** Interrogate testability, seams, scope realism, missing cases, and feasibility
  against the real code. Record every substantive challenge **into `specification.md`**: add/extend an
  `## Engineering review` section and new `- [ ]` open questions on the spec. Raise substantive changes
  to ACs/TCs as **proposals** — do not unilaterally rewrite them; when the spec is `Published: yes`,
  **annotate only, never mutate `[Uxx]` / `[ACxx]` / `[TCxx]` IDs** (those route through the specs
  repo's human change-management).
- **Design the implementation.** Author each `design.md` section: Context & problem, Requirements
  coverage (with the challenge notes cross-referencing the spec's `## Engineering review`), Architecture
  & components, Interfaces / contracts, Seams, Data flow, Error handling & edge cases, Test strategy,
  Risks & mitigations, Migration / rollout / backward-compatibility, Out of scope. Omit a
  non-applicable section with a one-line `_N/A — why_`.

As each decision settles, append it to `_design-session.md`; capture a genuinely-ambiguous term in
`_design-glossary.md`. **Resolve `design.md` open questions to zero** — the design is the last gate
before code. A residual engineering unknown that truly cannot be resolved is either (a) pushed onto the
`specification.md` as a spec-level `- [ ]` for the PM (and the design waits on it), or (b) kept as a
`design.md` `- [ ]` that will **block handoff** (Phase 6/7). A repo gap surfacing here → hard-stop (the
Phase 3 strict gate); resumable from `_design-session.md`.

---

## Phase 5.5 — Structural pre-lint

Before the review gate, run the deterministic checks in
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/pre-lint.md` against the drafted `design.md`: the **Universal checks**
plus the **design** block (core headings present; a MODERATE+ design has `## Seams` or a `_N/A — why_`;
report the `## Open questions` `- [ ]` count). Surface every finding; inline-fix the mechanical ones
(delete a stray placeholder token); leave content gaps for the grill/author. **Advisory** — never
blocks; proceed to Phase 6 once findings are surfaced. `design-reviewer` remains the gate (it still
enforces the open-questions hard block).

## Phase 6 — Review gate

Dispatch `design-reviewer` (Opus):

→ task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:design-reviewer", model: `<review_model — §2 Opus chain; caller-pinned, recorded>`):
  > "Review the design for this brief:
  >
  > Design path:        [absolute path to design.md]
  > Specification path: [absolute path to specification.md]
  > Classification:     [the Phase 1.5 classification]
  > applicable_ard:     [the ARD invariants resolved in Phase 2.5, or omit if none]"

**Act on the verdict** (mirrors `specify:`):
- **`BLOCK`** — fix the BLOCKER findings (the orchestrator/grill edits `design.md` inline — no delegated
  writer) and re-review once. **Any unresolved `design.md` `- [ ]` is a BLOCKER by policy** — resolve it
  or push it onto the spec (Phase 5) before handoff. If still `BLOCK`, escalate per the
  `Review verdict BLOCK (unresolved after one fix cycle) — epics:` rule in
  `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/escalation-rules.md`, per unresolved BLOCKER individually:
  `choices: ["Provide manual fix notes (you'll be prompted)", "Defer to a follow-up issue (record in the final report)", "Override and accept the finding", "Cancel the whole run", "Other… (describe)"]`
- **`MAJOR` / `MINOR` / `NIT`** (surfaced under `PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS`) — defer to the final
  report; no mandatory fix cycle.
- **`PASS`** / **`PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS`** — proceed to Phase 7.

Cap: one fix cycle + one re-review maximum. Phase 7 will not hand off a `design.md` with any unresolved
`- [ ]`.

---

## Phase 7 — Handoff

Write the feature folder: `design.md` (flat, alongside `specification.md`), the updated
`specification.md` (its `## Engineering review` + open-question edits), `_design-session.md`, and
`_design-glossary.md`. **Refuse to proceed if `design.md` has any unresolved `- [ ]`** (the
decision-completeness gate).

Then **offer** (commit-when-asked — never automatic):
`choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git", "Cancel"]`

On the first choice, in the specs repo (`$SPECS_PATH`): create the branch — `design/<EPIC>-<eslug>` for
a **per-Epic** or **stand-alone-Epic** design (`<EPIC>` = `focus_key`, which for a stand-alone Epic
equals `jira_key`), or `design/<VI>-<vslug>` for a **broad VI-level** design (`focus_key` null). Epic
keys are globally unique, so the per-Epic form needs no VI prefix; both forms use hyphens. main is
protected — a PR is required — so commit ONLY the feature folder (never `git add -A`), push, and open a
PR targeting `main`. **Merged-to-main = ready for `implement:`.** Commit trailer:
`Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>`.

### Next Epic (after a per-Epic design from a multi-Epic VI)

When this run designed a per-Epic Epic selected from Phase 0's ≥2-Epics picker, offer — once the
write/commit completes:
`choices: ["Next Epic — re-open the picker (Recommended)", "Stop here", "Other… (describe)"]`
On **"Next Epic"**, re-render the Phase 0 picker **minus the just-completed Epic** (recompute each
remaining Epic's ○/◐/● state — the freshly-authored design now shows **● done** and drops out of the
actionable set), then, on selection, loop back through Phases 2–7 for the selected Epic. This offer does
not apply to a stand-alone Epic, a single-Epic VI, or a broad VI-level design.

## Phase 8 — Session maintenance & feedback

Terminal phase — runs after Phase 7 and before the Final report is presented;
NEVER interrupts an earlier phase. `design:` has no built-in maintenance agent,
so this phase invokes `impl-maintenance` on the Sonnet detection chain and then
persists the plugin-facing slice of its report as session feedback.

**Capture-at-block invariant.** This terminal phase captures gaps for a *completed* run. Separately, if an EARLIER phase **halts on a plugin / skill / command / reference gap** (a capability the run needed but the plugin lacked), `emit-block` (per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md`) at that halt **before** escalating — so a run abandoned at the block still records the gap. NEVER `emit-block` for a work-quality review BLOCK or an environment / user halt (repo/spec gate, jira-not-found, cancellation).

**Session-hygiene invariant.** End the report with a `### Context hygiene` block per
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md` — prepare-first (`resume.md`), then a
same-role `/compact` suggestion + `/rename <VI-ID>-<slug>-team`. Guidance only, never auto-run.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (agent_type: "dev-workflows:impl-maintenance", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
   > "Analyse this session and return a Lessons Learned report.
   >
   > Session handoff:
   > - Command run: design:
   > - What was done: [one-paragraph summary of the engineering design authored]
   > - Key events: [BLOCK reviews and their reason, STRICT repo-gate hard-stops, model-gate overrides, unresolved design open questions — or 'none']
   > - Workarounds used: [manual steps not automated by the workflow — or 'none']
   > - Review verdict: [the design-reviewer verdict — PASS | PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS | BLOCK]
   > - Test result: N/A (no tests in design:)
   > - Project root: [the resolved feature folder under $SPECS_PATH]"
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Project the report's plugin-facing
   slice into the specs repo by citing
   `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md` and calling its
   `emit-auto` entry point (§6). Pass the Lessons Learned report,
   `command: design:`, the run's `jira_key` and `source`, and `plugin_version`
   (read from `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/.plugin/plugin.json`). `emit-auto`
   renders only the report's **Command workflow improvements**, **New agents /
   skills**, and plugin **Reference docs** sections plus the **Key observations**
   that triggered them (§4) — never target-project `copilot-instructions.md`/hook advice — as
   `origin: auto` entries, dedupes by stable `id` (§3), resolves the target via
   the §2 specs-first ladder, and writes silently.
3. **Surface** the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing
   persisted") as this phase's only output.

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits (git is offered only in
Phase 7), and NEVER writes into the current working directory. The specs-first
ladder writes the feedback file inside `$SPECS_PATH`, alongside the feature
folder — the intended home.


## Final report

Report: feature-folder path; classification + model-gate outcome; `design.md` sections authored (and
those `_N/A_`); spec challenges recorded (count of `## Engineering review` notes / new spec `- [ ]`);
confirmed repo set (and any removed-from-scope); the `design-reviewer` verdict; the PR URL (if opened);
and the `### Next step` recommendation (below).

### Next step

End the report with a `### Next step` recommendation per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/next-phase-offer.md` (guidance only — never auto-invoked): hand to the team → `implement: <VI> <Epic>` (depth); the **Epic fan-out** `design: <VI> <another-Epic>` designs a sibling Epic (breadth). If the run BLOCKED or `design.md` has open questions, recommend resolving those first.

### Context hygiene

Write the resume pointer at `<VI-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` (per `session-hygiene.md` §1). Then:

- **Continuing on this Epic (`ready:` / `implement: <VI> <Epic>`) or the next Epic (`design: <VI> <Epic2>`) — all still Team?** → run **`/compact`** — context stays relevant.
- Consider **`/rename <VI-ID>-<slug>-team`** to relocate this session later.

Guidance only — see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md`.
