---

Implement the following: the argument (text following the `implement:` trigger)

---

## Phase 0 — Load and classify inputs

the argument (text following the `implement:` trigger) may contain free-text prose plus **zero or more `@path` tokens** (today's single-`@file` form is a subset). Resolve each `@path` relative to the current working directory. Classify each `@path` — and the current working directory — **by inspection, not by matching the path string**:

| Detected as | Recognition rule | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| **Spec file** | a single `.md` file | read fully; use as the description/spec |
| **Spec folder** | a directory containing `prompt.md` and/or a `*-design.md` | read all `.md` specs within; fold into the description |
| **Jira ticket folder** | a directory containing a `*-index.md`, or ticket-key subdirectories each containing a `KEY.md` | hand to `jira-reader` in Phase 1.7 |
| **Code repo** | a directory where `git -C <path> rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` succeeds (includes the cwd) | scan target in Phase 1.7 |

**Jira-input resolution (shared front-end).** Before the per-`@path`
classification above, run `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/jira-input-resolution.md`
against the argument (text following the `implement:` trigger). It unifies the input grammar with `document:`: a **JiraID**
token (`^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+`) is discovered under `$VAULT_PATH/jira-products/`
(Fallbacks A/B on miss); a directory that inspects as a **jira-export** is used as
`jira_export_root`; a **spec-folder** contributes to `specs`; everything else is
`direct` (free-text/`@file`, this command's existing flow). The classification
table above is the directory branch of that front-end — a Jira ticket folder ↔
jira-export, a spec folder ↔ spec-folder, a code repo ↔ an `implement:`-only
target. Carry `mode`, `jira_key`, `jira_export_root`, `focus_key`, and `specs` forward.

**Epic-unit resolution (jira-driven).** `implement:` implements one Epic at a time.
After the front-end resolves, when `mode: jira-driven`:

- **`focus_key` set** (explicit `<VI> <Epic>`, a bare nested `<Epic>`, or chosen in
  the picker below) → proceed for that Epic. The Jira read (Phase 1.7) and specs
  resolution both scope to it.
- **`focus_key` null** → classify the target with a cheap `jira-reader`
  `depth: vi-plus-epics` read on `jira_export_root`, then follow
  `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/jira-input-resolution.md` §"Progress-aware Epic
  picker":
  - the item is **itself an Epic** (stand-alone / top-level) → no picker; proceed
    directly (`focus_key` stays null; specs resolve at the item's top-level dir).
  - **VI with exactly 1 Epic** → no picker; set `focus_key` to that Epic and proceed.
  - **VI with ≥2 Epics** → render the picker. `implement:`'s **done-predicate is the
    Epic's Jira status** (`linked_items[].status`): map *done / closed / resolved* →
    ● (greyed, not default-selectable; selecting offers "implement anyway"), *in
    progress / in review* → ◐, anything else → ○; always show the raw status text
    beside each row so a lagging status can't mislead. If the export carries no
    status, degrade to a plain unstatused selection list. Include the explicit choice
    **"Implement one broad VI-level slice instead"** (`focus_key` stays null → specs
    resolve VI-level). Selecting an Epic sets `focus_key` and proceeds for **that Epic
    only** — there is **no "Next Epic?" loop** (code-writing is heavy and branchy;
    each `implement:` run targets one Epic).
  - **VI with 0 Epics** → offer: split with `epics:` first (then re-import), or
    implement one broad VI-level slice (`focus_key` stays null).

When the picker (or the 1-Epic auto-path) sets `focus_key` that was initially null,
**re-resolve `specs`** per the shared reference §Specs-resolution now that `focus_key`
is set — the front-end's first pass resolved `specs` with `focus_key` null, so it must
run again to pick up the Epic's nested per-Epic home.

Rules:
- The **primary description** is: the spec file if one was given → else the spec-folder design doc → else the inline prose. Echo `📄 Reading prompt from <file>…` (or `from inline text`) and confirm `"Loaded prompt (N lines)."`.
- **Design-doc open-question guard.** If the primary description is a **design doc** — a file named
  `design.md` or matching `*-design.md` (the `design:` output; distinct from a `specification.md`) —
  scan it for unresolved `- [ ]` open questions under its `## Open questions` heading. If any exist,
  **refuse to proceed**:
  `choices: ["Cancel — resolve the design's open questions in design: first (Recommended)", "Override and implement anyway (logged in the Phase 5 report)", "Other… (describe)"]`
  A design must be decision-complete before implementation (enforced upstream by `design-reviewer`;
  this is the cross-command backstop). **`specification.md`-level open questions are exempt** — they are
  the spec's way of flagging what the design phase resolves, and a design doc may legitimately
  incorporate a spec that still carries them. "Override" is the only escape and is recorded in the
  Phase 5 report's `### Assumptions & limitations`.
- Multiple inputs of the same kind are allowed.
- A referenced `@dir` that is missing, or is neither a recognized folder type nor a git repo, MUST be surfaced to the user immediately (do not silently skip) — then ask whether to continue without it or stop. This mirrors `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §8.4.
- Note any embedded images as "referenced image: <path>".
- If a single `@file` cannot be read, stop and report the error immediately.
- **Specs are required for jira-driven runs.** When `mode: jira-driven` and the
  front-end resolved `specs: []`, do not plan blind — prompt:
  `choices: ["Point me at a specs directory (you'll provide the path)", "Proceed without specs — not recommended", "Cancel"]`
  "Point me…" takes a path, classifies it as a spec-folder, and re-resolves
  `specs`. "Proceed without specs" is logged in the Phase 5 report's
  `### Assumptions & limitations`. Direct-mode runs (no Jira input) are exempt —
  the prompt/spec file is the instruction.

---

## Phase 0.5 — Readiness pre-flight (jira-driven only; advisory)

**Jira mode only.** When `mode: direct` this phase is a **no-op** — skip it entirely
(direct-mode runs are byte-identical to before).

When `mode: jira-driven`, read the resolved item's declared Jira status (reuse the
Phase 0 `vi-plus-epics` read if it ran, else a cheap Status-column read of
`<jira_export_root>/<jira_key>-index.md`). Also, if `$SPECS_PATH` is set, check for a
co-located `_readiness.md` in the item's specs dir.

Surface a **one-line, non-blocking** recommendation to run `ready: <VI> [<Epic>]` first when
EITHER: the status is below the readiness bar (VI below **Ready for Implementation**; Epic below
**Refined**), OR a `_readiness.md` records **NOT-SUPPORTED** / **PARTIAL**. This NEVER blocks —
proceed regardless; it is guidance only. If neither condition holds, say nothing and continue.

---

## Phase 1 — Clarification

**Rule: Ask, don't guess. This rule is absolute.**

Before producing a plan, analyze the description for:
- Ambiguous scope or unclear boundaries
- Missing constraints (performance, security, backwards-compatibility)
- Multiple valid implementation approaches
- Undefined integration points or dependencies
- Missing acceptance criteria

If **any** ambiguity exists, ask the user. Rules:
- Use `choices` arrays for every question — never plain text questions
- The **last choice** in every `choices` array MUST be `"Other… (describe)"` to allow free-text
- When a clearly superior default exists, make it the first choice and label it `"(Recommended)"`
- Group related decisions into a single question (minimize total questions)
- Do **not** proceed until all questions are answered

If **nothing** is ambiguous, skip directly to Phase 1.5.

---

## Phase 1.5 — Classify task complexity

Load and follow the model-routing policy at `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md`, then classify the task as exactly one of:

- **SIMPLE** — local, trivial, clearly reversible; no mandatory Opus steps
- **MODERATE** — bounded scope, few files, clear requirements; no mandatory Opus steps
- **SIGNIFICANT** — risky in at least one dimension from the classification reference; Opus planning + Opus review are mandatory
- **HIGH-RISK** — multiple risky dimensions, or security/migration/compliance scope; Opus planning + Opus review are mandatory and must be especially thorough

State the classification and the specific criterion that triggered it. When in doubt between MODERATE and SIGNIFICANT, pick SIGNIFICANT.

**Resolve the per-step routing.** Following `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §9, record a `model_routing` block resolving each model against the fallback chains:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: <SIMPLE | MODERATE | SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK>
  reason: <one-line>
  current_model: <the model this orchestrator is running under>   # = the inline implementation coding
  detection_model: <§2.1 detection chain: claude-sonnet-4.6, fallback claude-sonnet-4.5/gpt-5.4>   # jira-reader, code-scanner, Phase 2A exploration, test-writer, test-baseliner, review-fixer
  planning_model: <§2 Opus chain>   # risk-planner (Phase 2B; SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK only; frontmatter-pinned, recorded, no override)
  review_model:  <§2 Opus chain>    # code-review (Phase 3B; frontmatter-pinned, recorded, no override)
  implementation_model: <= current_model>   # coding done inline by the orchestrator
  fixes_model: <= detection_model>          # review-fixer (Phase 3B)
  opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
  notes: <any §2 / §2.1 fallback or degradation>
```

Each subagent dispatch below cites its chain (§9 role→chain map); mechanical steps pin `detection_model` via `model:`, and the frontmatter-Opus gates (`risk-planner`, `code-review`) are recorded but never overridden.

Then choose the branch:

- **SIMPLE / MODERATE** → continue to Phase 2A (standard planning)
- **SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK** → continue to Phase 2B (Opus-planned)

---

## Phase 1.6 — Input scale assessment

From the Phase 0 classification, compute:
- `repo_count` = number of code repos (cwd + referenced git-repo dirs)
- `has_ticket_folder` = any Jira ticket folder present
- `has_spec_folder` = any spec/design folder present

Set `fan_out = (repo_count > 1) OR has_ticket_folder OR has_spec_folder`.

- **`fan_out = true`** → the input is multi-source. Per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §1.1 (the multi-source trigger; see §8 for the fan-out policy) this floors the classification at **SIGNIFICANT** (raise it now if Phase 1.5 chose SIMPLE/MODERATE). Announce: `"Multi-source input detected (<facts>) — flooring at SIGNIFICANT; this is overridable at plan approval."` Then run **Phase 1.7** (fan-out scan) and continue on the SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK branch (Phase 2B).
- **`fan_out = false`** → unchanged behavior; skip Phase 1.7 and proceed to Phase 2A or 2B exactly as the Phase 1.5 classification directs (the single-explorer path).

---

## Phase 1.7 — Multi-source exploration (only when `fan_out = true`)

Runs after Phase 1.6 and replaces the single Phase 2B exploration subagent for multi-source input. Follows `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §8.

1. **Read Jira ticket folders.** For each Jira ticket folder, invoke `jira-reader` (read-only):

   → task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:jira-reader", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
     > "Return the structured handoff for this brief — linked items, PR URLs (identifiers only — no fetching), and capability themes:
     >
     > jira_export_root: [the resolved jira_export_root (from the Phase 0 front-end), or the ticket-folder absolute path]
     > jira_key:         [the resolved <KEY>]
     > depth:            full"

   Run multiple `jira-reader` calls sequentially (it is fast and read-only). Collect the themes and PR references.

   When `focus_key` is set, scope the collected result to the focus Epic's subtree:
   keep the focus Epic plus the items linked beneath it (its Stories / Sub-tasks) and
   drop sibling Epics' subtrees before folding themes/PRs into the plan. `jira-reader`
   itself is not modified — the scoping is done here, mirroring `specify:`.

2. **Read spec/design folders inline.** Read each spec-folder `.md` and fold its content into the themes and primary description.

3. **Fan out `code-scanner` — one per repo, single response, cap 4 concurrent.** Spawn all repo scanners in **one** message (batch in groups of 4 if there are more than 4 repos). For each code repo:

   → task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:code-scanner", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
     > "repo_path: <absolute repo path>
     >  capability_themes: <themes from steps 1–2 + the implementation spec>
     >  context: <3–5 sentences: the implementation goal and what the change must accomplish>
     >  search_hints: <symbols/paths/keywords derived from the spec, if any>"

   Wait for all scanners in the batch to return. A scanner returning `DIRTY_TREE`/`REFRESH_BLOCKED` is surfaced, not hidden.

4. **Synthesize.** Combine the `jira-reader` output, all `code-scanner` reports, and the spec into a single **multi-source codebase summary** (per-repo: relevant files, existing capabilities, gaps; plus the cross-repo picture and the Jira themes/PR references). This summary is the codebase context for Phase 2B — do **not** also run the single Explore subagent.

---

## Phase 1.8 — Resolve applicable ARD (Jira mode; optional)

Only when the run resolved a Jira key (VI/Epic) — i.e. NOT direct-prompt mode — resolve any ARD by citing `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/ard-resolution.md` with the resolved `<VI>`, `<EPIC>`, and `$SPECS_PATH`. Direct mode (no Jira key) → treat as `status: none`. On `status: none`, **skip and proceed exactly as before**. On `status: found`, carry the `invariants` as **implementation guardrails** (the implementer honors each `AD-N` `rule`; a necessary deviation is logged as an `- ARD deviation:` line in the Phase 5 report), and — in the SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK path — pass them to `code-review` (Phase 3B) as `applicable_ard`. In the SIMPLE / MODERATE path there is no `code-review` gate, so the guardrails act as guidance only.

---

## Phase 2A — Standard Plan (SIMPLE / MODERATE only)

**Codebase exploration** — Before writing the plan, spawn an exploration subagent to map the relevant parts of the codebase:

→ task(agent_type: "general-purpose", tools: view/glob/grep only — no bash, no edit, model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
  "Given this implementation description: [paste the full implementation description from Phase 0 or Phase 1 here], find and return:
   - Relevant source files and their primary responsibility
   - Existing patterns and conventions used in this codebase
   - Test file locations and test naming conventions
   - Naming conventions (class names, method names, file names)
   Return a structured summary — no code changes, no file edits."

**Wait for the agent's response before proceeding. If the agent returns no relevant files or fails, proceed with the plan using your own file reads to gather context. Do not begin writing the plan until the file map is returned or you have gathered context yourself.**

→ Use the returned file map as codebase context when writing the plan below.

Produce a written implementation plan:

1. **Classification** — `SIMPLE` or `MODERATE` (with reason)
2. **Goal** — one-sentence summary of what will be built
3. **Approach** — chosen strategy and why
4. **Steps** — numbered, concrete implementation steps
5. **Files to create/modify** — list with brief rationale
6. **Tests** — what tests will be added or run
7. **Assumptions** — decisions made without user input (must be minimal)
8. **Out of scope** — explicitly list what is NOT being done

Then ask:
```
"Implementation plan ready. What would you like to do?"
choices: ["Approve & implement now (Recommended)", "Revise plan", "Cancel"]
```

- **Approve** → proceed to Phase 3A
- **Revise** → ask what to change, update, re-show, re-ask
- **Cancel** → stop and summarize what was planned

---

## Phase 2B — Opus-planned (SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK)

**Codebase exploration** — If Phase 1.7 ran (`fan_out = true`), use its **multi-source codebase summary** as the codebase context and skip the single Explore subagent. Otherwise, run the same exploration subagent call as Phase 2A (same prompt, same fallback rule).

Once the file map is returned, delegate planning to Opus.

→ task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:risk-planner"):  # planning_model — §2 Opus chain; frontmatter-pinned, recorded in model_routing, no override added
  > "Produce the risk-weighted plan for the following brief:
  >
  > Task description: [substitute full description]
  > Classification: [SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK] — reason: [the criterion from Phase 1.5, or the multi-source floor from Phase 1.6 when fan_out]
  > Codebase summary: [paste the Phase 1.7 multi-source summary if fan_out, else the Explore agent's output]
  > Constraints: [any from clarification, plus runtime/version/deadline known]
  > Current state: branch = [git branch], uncommitted = [git status --short summary]"

**Wait for the risk-planner to return.** Its output is one of:

1. A full plan in the risk-weighted format (the normal case).
2. A short `### Re-classification` section, if the planner decided on inspection that the task is actually `SIMPLE` or `MODERATE`.

**If the return contains `### Re-classification`:** surface it to the user, ask for confirmation of the revised level with a `choices` prompt (`["Accept revised classification (Recommended)", "Override and stay SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK", "Cancel"]`). If the user accepts, **fall back to Phase 2A** (standard plan) using the codebase context already captured above — the Phase 1.7 **multi-source codebase summary** when `fan_out = true`, otherwise the Explore summary — and do not re-run exploration. Accepting here is the user exercising the **plan-approval override** of the multi-source SIGNIFICANT floor (Phase 1.6); that is the sanctioned way to leave the fan_out floor. If the user overrides, re-invoke risk-planner with an additional constraint stating the classification is intentional; do not down-classify again. If the user cancels, stop and summarize.

**If the return is a full plan:** present it to the user verbatim and ask:

```
"Opus-planned. What would you like to do?"
choices: ["Approve & implement now (Recommended)", "Revise plan", "Cancel"]
```

- **Approve** → proceed to Phase 3B
- **Revise** → ask what to change, then re-invoke risk-planner with the **complete** brief plus the additional constraint merged in (never send just a delta — the planner refuses to plan without a full brief). Re-show, re-ask.
- **Cancel** → stop and summarize

---

## Pre-Phase 3 — Create feature branch

Before writing any file:

1. **Clean-tree check** — Run `git status --porcelain`. If the output is non-empty:
   - Show the user what is dirty (paste the `git status --short` output).
   - Ask:
     ```
     choices: ["Stash changes and continue (Recommended)", "Proceed anyway — pre-existing changes will appear in the diff and review outputs", "Cancel"]
     ```
   - **Stash**: run `git stash push -m "pre-impl stash"`, then continue.
   - **Proceed**: note in the Phase 5 report that the working tree was dirty at implementation start.
   - **Cancel**: stop and summarize what was planned.

2. **Detect naming convention** — check `git branch -a` for the project's branch prefix (`feat/`, `feature/`, `chore/`, `story/`, etc.). Default to `feat/` if ambiguous.

3. **Generate slug** — derive from the implementation description: lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars, strip punctuation and special chars. Example: "Add user authentication to login page" → `add-user-authentication-login-page`.

4. **Check HEAD context** — if HEAD is NOT on the default branch (`main` / `master` / `develop`), check for ahead commits: `git log origin/HEAD..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null`. If output is non-empty (branch has commits ahead), ask:
   ```
   choices: ["Branch from current position — continue on this work (Recommended)", "Branch from default branch — fresh start", "Cancel"]
   ```

5. **Create and checkout** — `git checkout -b <prefix>/<slug>`. If that name already exists, append the first 7 chars of HEAD's SHA: `<prefix>/<slug>-<short-sha>`.

---

## Pre-Phase 3.5 — Capture test baseline

Placed **after** branch creation (Pre-Phase 3), **before** any file edits. The `.5` numbering signals "inserted between step 3 and step 4 of the existing ordering" — it is its own phase, not a sub-step of Pre-Phase 3's branch-creation steps.

Invoke the `test-baseliner` agent in capture mode:

→ task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:test-baseliner", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
  > "Run the agent in the following mode:
  >
  > Mode: capture
  > Project root: [absolute path of the current working directory]"

Store the returned `## Test Baseline` block verbatim — it will be passed to `test-baseliner` again in verify mode at Phase 3.5 and to `test-writer` as the baseline snapshot. If `Framework: not detected`, note it in session memory but continue — Phase 3.5 will surface the missing-framework case to the user explicitly.

---

## Phase 3A — Implementation (SIMPLE / MODERATE)

**Implement immediately. Do NOT ask "Should I implement?" or any variation.**

1. Work through each step in order
2. Make precise, surgical changes — do not modify unrelated code
3. Follow existing code style and LF line endings
4. Assume broad permissions; avoid unnecessary stops
5. If a **new ambiguity** emerges mid-implementation: STOP, ask with choices (last: `"Other… (describe)"`), resume after answer
6. **Run Phase 3.5 below** (test writing + regression verification) — do NOT run tests directly here; Phase 3.5 owns the lint/build/test sequence and the fix loop
7. Verify the outcome matches the approved plan
8. Proceed to Phase 4 (post-implementation maintenance).

---

## Phase 3.5 — Write and verify tests (SIMPLE / MODERATE)

Runs after Phase 3A step 5 completes (all code changes written), before the outcome-verification step.

1. **Invoke `test-writer` agent**:

   → task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:test-writer", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
     > "Write tests for this brief:
     >
     > Task description: [substitute full description]
     > Plan: [paste the approved Phase 2A plan]
     > Diff: [paste `git add -N . && git diff` output so new files are included]
     > Project root: [absolute path]
     > Baseline: [paste the ## Test Baseline block captured in Pre-Phase 3.5]"

2. **Handle `Framework: not detected`.** If the `test-writer` report shows `Framework: not detected`, ask the user:
   ```
   choices: ["Specify test command to use", "Skip tests for this run (document why in the final report — Phase 5 of the inherited implement: workflow)", "Cancel"]
   ```
   - **Specify test command** → take free-text, use it as the test runner for step 4 below; continue.
   - **Skip tests** → take free-text rationale; record it in the Phase 5 `### Deferred items` section; skip steps 3–5 of Phase 3.5 and proceed to Phase 3A step 7 (Verify outcome).
   - **Cancel** → stop and summarize.

3. **Run linters and builds.** Use the project's standard lint/build commands as discovered in Phase 2A exploration. Do not run the full test suite here — that is step 4.

4. **Invoke `test-baseliner` in verify mode** against the baseline captured in Pre-Phase 3.5:

   → task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:test-baseliner", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
     > "Run the agent in the following mode:
     >
     > Mode: verify
     > Baseline: [paste the captured ## Test Baseline block]
     > Project root: [absolute path]"

5. **Fix loop** — if the verify report lists regressions or new failures:
   - The **session model** (not a subagent) applies fixes. No `review-fixer`-style indirection is used here — the scope is narrow and the context is already fully in-session. Use the `test-baseliner` verify report as the authoritative list of what broke.
   - After each fix attempt, re-capture the diff (`git add -N . && git diff`) and re-run `test-baseliner` in verify mode against the **original** baseline (never re-baseline mid-loop — a mid-loop re-baseline would silently absorb a regression as the new normal).
   - Cap at **2 fix attempts**. If regressions remain after the second attempt, surface to the user:
     ```
     choices: ["Investigate further", "Accept regressions and proceed (document in Phase 5 report)", "Cancel"]
     ```
     - **Investigate further** → stop the automated loop; the session model diagnoses manually and re-runs verify when ready.
     - **Accept regressions** → record each regression in the Phase 5 `### Deferred items` section with the user's rationale; proceed.
     - **Cancel** → stop and summarize.

Once Phase 3.5 returns (passed, skipped, or accepted-with-regressions), return to Phase 3A step 7 (Verify outcome).

---

## Phase 3B — Implementation + Opus review (SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK)

Use the currently selected model or Sonnet for implementation itself. Opus is reserved for the review.

For a long step list, apply `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/context-management.md` — checkpoint at N,
offload parallel-safe (`[P]`) steps to subagents, or decompose — so the run does not degrade as context fills.

At each checkpoint, also consider suggesting **`/compact`** to free context before the next scope/Epic (per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md` §3 — mid-command → `/compact` only, never `/clear`; guidance only).

1. Work through each step in order
2. Make precise, surgical changes — do not modify unrelated code
3. Follow existing code style and LF line endings
4. If a **new ambiguity** emerges mid-implementation: STOP, ask with choices (last: `"Other… (describe)"`), resume after answer
4a. **Invoke `test-writer` agent** (inserted before diff capture so the Opus review sees code and tests together — test adequacy is already a review dimension in `code-review.md`):

   → task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:test-writer", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
     > "Write tests for this brief:
     >
     > Task description: [substitute full description]
     > Plan: [paste the risk-planner plan approved in Phase 2B]
     > Diff: [paste `git add -N . && git diff` output so new files are included]
     > Project root: [absolute path]
     > Baseline: [paste the ## Test Baseline block captured in Pre-Phase 3.5]"

   If the `test-writer` report shows `Framework: not detected`, ask the user **before** invoking Opus review (mirrors the SIMPLE/MODERATE branch — keeps the Opus-review input deterministic):
   ```
   choices: ["Specify test command to use", "Skip tests for this run (document why in the final report — Phase 5 of the inherited implement: workflow)", "Cancel"]
   ```
   Record the choice. A "Skip" decision must be explicit and logged in the Phase 5 report.

5. After all changes are written: **DO NOT run tests yet.** Capture the diff and the project root. Use `git add -N . && git diff` — this includes intent-to-add untracked new files so the diff is never empty for implementations that only create new files, and it now also includes the test files from step 4a. Also capture `git diff --stat` for the summary.
6. **Opus code review** — spawn.

   → task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:code-review"):  # review_model — §2 Opus chain; frontmatter-pinned, recorded in model_routing, no override added
     > "Produce the Opus code review for this brief:
     >
     > Task description: [substitute full description]
     > Classification: [SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK] — reason: [from Phase 1.5]
     > Plan: [paste the risk-planner plan approved in Phase 2B]
     > Diff: [paste git diff output]
     > Project root: [absolute path]
     > applicable_ard: [the ARD invariants from Phase 1.8, or omit if none / direct mode]"

7. Act on the return:
   - **`### Re-classification` section** — the reviewer decided the change is actually `SIMPLE` or `MODERATE` on inspection. Surface it to the user and ask `choices: ["Accept revised classification (Recommended)", "Override and keep the BLOCK-gated review", "Cancel"]`. If accepted, treat the review as an implicit PASS: skip the BLOCK branch, proceed to step 8, and do NOT re-invoke the reviewer on later fix deltas. Record the revised classification for the Phase 5 report. If overridden, re-invoke code-review with an explicit note that the classification is intentional.
   - **BLOCK** — invoke the review-fixer agent (see Review-fixer sub-step below). If `Stop condition flag` is `CLEAR`, re-run the Opus code review on the updated diff (one re-review only). If the second verdict is still BLOCK, stop: surface the remaining blockers to the user and ask `choices: ["Investigate further", "Abandon implementation and restore to pre-impl state", "Cancel"]`. Do not run tests until the verdict is not BLOCK.
   - **PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS** — invoke the review-fixer agent for MAJOR findings (see Review-fixer sub-step below). MINOR / NIT findings may be deferred — note them in the Phase 5 report.
   - **PASS** — proceed.

   **Review-fixer sub-step** (for BLOCK and PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS):

   → task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:review-fixer", model: `<fixes_model — = detection_model, §2.1 detection chain>`):
     > "Fix the review findings for this brief:
     >
     > Task description: [substitute full description]
     > Review output: [paste the full code-review agent output]
     > Project root: [absolute path]
     > Severities to fix: BLOCKER and MAJOR"

   Wait for the fix report. Re-capture the diff after the fixer completes.
8. **Run Phase 3.5 (post-review).** After the review gate clears (non-BLOCK verdict), run the Phase 3.5 sequence (lint/build, `test-baseliner` verify, fix loop) — **not before**. This preserves the invariant "NEVER run tests for SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK before Opus review returns non-BLOCK". The fix loop inside Phase 3.5 applies fixes via the session model; if the fixes are non-trivial **and** the reviewer was NOT down-classified in step 7, re-invoke the Opus code review on the delta after Phase 3.5 completes. If the reviewer WAS down-classified, skip the re-review.
9. Verify the outcome matches the approved plan and the review verdict.
10. Proceed to Phase 4.

## Phase 4 — Post-implementation maintenance (both branches)

First gather the actual change context:

a. Run `git diff --stat` (or equivalent) and capture the list of changed files with line counts.
b. Compose a **change summary block**:

```
Implementation: [one-sentence description of what was built]
Change type: code
Classification: [SIMPLE | MODERATE | SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK]
Files changed (from git diff --stat):
<paste the git diff --stat output>
Notable additions/removals: [new commands, APIs, config keys, dependencies — one line each; or "none"]
Opus review verdict: [PASS | PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS | BLOCK — or "N/A (SIMPLE / MODERATE)"]
```

Then spawn all four agents. They are independent and can run in any order — spawn them all before waiting for any to complete:

**Agent 1 — Documentation** (general-purpose):
> "Post-implementation documentation review. Change summary:
> [paste change summary block]
>
> Scan for README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/, or any .md files in the project root or a docs/ directory.
> Determine if documentation needs updating:
> - Skip if: purely a bug fix, vulnerability fix, internal refactor, or test-only change
> - Update if: new feature, changed behavior, new commands/APIs/config options, altered usage patterns
> Use the file list above to reason precisely about what changed. If an update is warranted: apply minimal edits to the relevant section(s).
> Return: file updated and what changed, OR 'no update required (reason)'."

**Agent 2 — Knowledge base** (general-purpose):
> "Post-implementation knowledge review. Change summary:
> [paste change summary block]
>
> Check ~/.copilot/memory/ (global) and .copilot/memory/ (project-level, preferred for repo-specific knowledge) for existing knowledge files.
> Determine if a new knowledge entry is warranted — look for: reusable insights or patterns, non-obvious constraints or gotchas, anti-patterns discovered, clarified trade-offs.
> If YES: append to the most appropriate existing file (never create a new file if an existing one fits) using this format:
> ### [Short title]
> - **Context**: what problem/situation triggered this
> - **Insight**: the learned rule, pattern, or gotcha
> - **When it applies**: conditions under which this matters
> - **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
> - **Ref**: [first 60 chars of implementation description]
> Return: file updated/created and summary of entry, OR 'no update required'."

**Agent 3 — Instructions** (general-purpose):
> "Post-implementation instructions review. Change summary:
> [paste change summary block]
>
> Check .github/copilot-instructions.md in the project root and ~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md (global).
> Determine if any rules, guidance, or guardrails are missing because of what this implementation revealed.
> Skip if: the implementation followed existing patterns with no surprises, required no novel constraints, and introduced no anti-patterns. Only update if a concrete, recurring rule would have prevented a decision point or misunderstanding during this implementation.
> If YES: apply minimal, additive, scoped changes only — do not rewrite sections wholesale.
> Return: what was changed and why, OR 'no update required'."

**Agent 4 — Session maintenance** (dev-workflows:impl-maintenance):
> "Analyse this session and return a Lessons Learned report.
>
> Session handoff:
> - Command run: implement:
> - What was done: [one-paragraph summary of the implementation]
> - Key events: [BLOCK reviews encountered and their reason, test regressions, workarounds, unexpected ambiguities — or 'none']
> - Workarounds used: [manual steps not automated by the workflow — or 'none']
> - Review verdict: [PASS | PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS | BLOCK | N/A]
> - Test result: [passed N tests, N regressions, not run — or actual result]
> - Project root: [absolute path]"

Collect all four summaries for the Phase 5 report.

**Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** After Agent 4 (`impl-maintenance`)
returns, project its plugin-facing slice into the specs repo by citing
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md` and calling its
`emit-auto` entry point (§6). Pass Agent 4's Lessons Learned report,
`command: implement:`, the run's `jira_key` and `source`, and `plugin_version`
(read from `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/.plugin/plugin.json`). `emit-auto`
renders only the report's **Command workflow improvements**, **New agents /
skills**, and plugin **Reference docs** sections plus the **Key observations**
that triggered them (§4 plugin-facing predicate) — never target-project
`copilot-instructions.md`/hook advice — as `origin: auto` entries, dedupes by stable `id`
(§3), resolves the target via the §2 specs-first ladder, and writes silently.
List the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted") in
the Phase 5 `### Session learnings` line. ADDITIVE — the impl-maintenance report
still appears in the report; this step NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits, and
NEVER writes into the code repo or the current working directory.

---

## Phase 5 — Final Report

Output a structured report — do NOT ask any closing confirmation:

```
## Implementation Report

### Classification
[SIMPLE | MODERATE | SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK] — [reason]

### Branch
[branch name created in Pre-Phase 3, e.g. feat/add-user-authentication]

### What was implemented
[High-level summary]

### Files changed
- path/to/file.ext — [what changed]

### Opus review (if applicable)
[Verdict and 1-line summary, or "N/A (SIMPLE / MODERATE)"]

### Commands / tests run
- [command] → [result]

### Knowledge base
- [file updated/created] — [summary of entry] OR "no update required"

### Instructions
- [summary of change] OR "no update required"

### Documentation
- [file updated] — [what was added/changed] OR "no update required (bug fix / no user-facing change)" OR "no documentation files found"

### Session learnings
- [top suggestions from impl-maintenance agent, or "no suggestions — routine session"]

### Assumptions & limitations
- [list any]

### Deferred items (from review or tests)
- [MINOR / NIT findings that were not applied] OR "none"

### Next step
[Per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/next-phase-offer.md` — guidance only, never auto-invoked. Jira mode: finish the remaining Epics under the VI (breadth) — `implement: <VI> <another-Epic>` — and, once **all** Epics are implemented, `document: <VI>` then `release-notes: <VI>` (both VI-level, run once). Depth vs breadth is the team's call. Direct mode: no forward pipeline step (omit). If review is still BLOCK, resolve that first.]

### Context hygiene

*(Jira mode only — omit this whole block in direct-prompt mode, like the `### Next step` above.)*
Write the resume pointer at `<VI-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` (per `session-hygiene.md` §1). Then:

- **More Epics to build (`implement: <VI> <Epic2>`) or on to `document: <VI>` — same build lane?** → run **`/compact`** — context stays relevant.
- Consider **`/rename <VI-ID>-<slug>-team`** to relocate this session later.

Guidance only — see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md`.
```

---

## Phase 6 — Emit follow-up tasks

Terminal phase — runs AFTER the Phase 5 Final Report is composed; NEVER
interrupts an earlier phase. Persist the run's out-of-scope / manual-step
follow-ups by citing `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/followup-emission.md`
and executing its steps inline.

1. **Collect** the qualifying follow-ups: manual publish/config steps and
   out-of-scope maintenance items surfaced in the Phase 5 `### Session
   learnings` section (e.g. an impl-maintenance suggestion that touches
   another repo or team, or a manual post-merge step). **Do NOT** collect the
   report's `### Deferred items (from review or tests)` or skipped tests — §6
   explicitly excludes those as in-scope work already carried by the current
   task.
2. **Filter** them with the reference's §6 qualifying predicate.
3. **Resolve** the write target via the §4 ladder using `jira_key` and `source`
   (jira-driven runs carry a key; direct-prompt runs usually do not, so tasks
   land in `Tasks.md # Irregular` when the vault is writable, else report-only);
   render + place tasks and verbose notes per §1–§3; dedupe per §5.
4. **Preview + confirm** per §7 (`approve-all | select | cancel`), then write.

ADDITIVE — the follow-ups also remain in the Phase 5 report. This phase NEVER
fails the run, NEVER commits, and NEVER writes into the code repo or the current
working directory.

---

## Invariants (always enforced)

- ALWAYS `emit-block` (per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md`) before escalating a halt caused by a **plugin / skill / command / reference gap** (a capability the run needed but the plugin lacked) — so a run abandoned at the block still records it. NEVER for a work-quality review BLOCK or an environment / user halt (repo-missing, dirty-tree, jira-not-found, cancellation)
- NEVER skip Phase 1.5 classification — every run must state the level
- NEVER use Opus for routine implementation; reserve it for planning + review on SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK
- NEVER run tests on SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK work before the Opus code review returns a non-BLOCK verdict
- NEVER skip Phase 3.5 — if no test framework is detected, ask the user rather than silently skipping; a "Skip" decision must be explicit and logged in the Phase 5 report
- NEVER make assumptions that could have been asked — ask instead
- NEVER end implementation with "Should I implement?" — if approved, implement
- NEVER rewrite files wholesale when only an append/edit is needed
- NEVER skip Phase 4 — documentation, knowledge, instructions, and session-maintenance are mandatory after every successful impl; always collect all four agent summaries for Phase 5
- ALWAYS capture a test baseline (Pre-Phase 3.5) before writing any file
- ALWAYS create a feature branch (Pre-Phase 3) before writing any file — never implement directly on the default branch
- ALWAYS check for a clean working tree before branching; stash or get explicit user consent if dirty
- ALWAYS spawn Phase 4 agents in a single message — never sequentially
- ALWAYS use `choices` arrays for decision points; last choice is always `"Other… (describe)"`
- ALWAYS produce the Phase 5 report as the final output
- ALWAYS end the Phase 5 report with a `### Next step` recommendation (per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/next-phase-offer.md`) — guidance only, never auto-invoked; omitted in direct mode (no VI/Epic pipeline context)
- ALWAYS pass `Command run: implement:` in the Phase 4 Agent 4 session handoff
- ALWAYS pass `Change type: code` in the Phase 4 change summary block (scopes the four maintenance agents' suggestions to code-change territory — docs / Jira variants use `docs`)
- AFTER one review-fixer pass + one re-review, if verdict is still BLOCK: stop and surface to user — do NOT loop
- AFTER two Phase 3.5 fix-loop attempts, if regressions remain: stop and surface to user — do NOT loop
- ALWAYS classify each `@path` input by inspection (Phase 0) — never by matching the path string
- WHEN `fan_out` is true (multi-repo or any directory input): floor classification at SIGNIFICANT (overridable at plan approval), run Phase 1.7, and feed its synthesized summary to the planner instead of the single Explore subagent
- ALWAYS fan out `code-scanner` one-per-repo in a single response, capped at 4 concurrent — never sequentially
- NEVER silently skip a referenced `@dir` that is missing or unrecognized — surface it and ask (~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md §8.4)
- Scanning agents (`jira-reader`, `code-scanner`) are pinned to the §2.1 detection (Sonnet) chain like every mechanical step (never inherit the session model); escalate a single scanner to Opus only when one repo slice is oversized
- ALWAYS end the Phase 5 report with a `### Context hygiene` block per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md` — prepare-first (`resume.md`), then a same-lane `/compact` suggestion + `/rename <VI-ID>-<slug>-team`; **omitted in direct mode** (no VI/Epic context, no `resume.md`); the Phase 3B checkpoint additionally suggests `/compact` mid-run. Guidance only, never auto-run.
