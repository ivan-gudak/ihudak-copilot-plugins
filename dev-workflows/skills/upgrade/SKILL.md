Upgrade components: the argument (text following the `upgrade:` trigger)

Each token is one of: `component:1.2.3` (exact), `component:minor` (latest patch on current minor), `component:latest` (latest stable), `component:lts` (latest LTS), or bare `component` (latest compatible with everything else).

`component` can be a library, framework, language runtime, build tool, or path like `.github/workflows`.

All changes are left **uncommitted** on the current branch.

---

## Phase 1 — Compatibility Planning (no files changed)

1. **Inventory** — Detect all components and their current versions from build files, runtime version files, and CI YAML. Use `references/upgrade/ecosystems.md`.

2. **Resolve requested targets** — Apply the `Version Resolution` section below to each requested token.

3. **Delegate planning in parallel** — Spawn one planner task per requested component. Use a single agent message for the whole batch.

   Use this pattern for each component:

   ```
   task(
     agent_type: "dev-workflows:upgrade-planner",
     model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`,
     description: "Plan component upgrade",
     prompt: "## Upgrade Plan Request
     repo: [absolute repo path]
     component: [component name]
     target: [exact | minor | latest | lts | bare]
     other_upgrades:
       - name: [other requested component]
         target: [its target token]
     repo_inventory:
       [component]: [current version]
     model_routing:
       classification: [SIMPLE | MODERATE | SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK]
       reason: <one-line>
       current_model: <the model this orchestrator is running under>
       detection_model: <§2.1 detection chain: claude-sonnet-4.6, fallback claude-sonnet-4.5/gpt-5.4>   # upgrade-planner, test-baseliner; upgrade-executor (SIMPLE/MODERATE); review-fixer
       planning_model: <§2 Opus chain>   # risk-planner (SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK; frontmatter-pinned, recorded, no override); upgrade-executor escalates here only if HIGH-RISK
       review_model:  <§2 Opus chain>    # code-review (frontmatter-pinned; recorded, no override)
       opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
       gate_tests_on_review: <true for SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK, false otherwise>
       notes: <any §2 / §2.1 fallback or degradation>"
   )
   ```

4. **Collect planner results**
   - `READY` → candidate for execution
   - `NOT_FOUND` → warn and skip
   - `CONFLICT` → surface `conflict_details` and ranked `alternatives`; do not proceed until the conflict is resolved or the component is skipped

5. **Classify each READY component** — Load and follow the model-routing policy at `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md`, then record: the actual resolved change, related upgrades, and planner findings. Print one classification line per component. When in doubt, escalate to `SIGNIFICANT`.

6. **Risk plan for SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK components** — For every component classified `SIGNIFICANT` or `HIGH-RISK`, invoke `risk-planner` before execution (frontmatter-pinned to Opus; recorded as `planning_model` above, no `model:` override needed):

   ```
   task(
     agent_type: "dev-workflows:risk-planner",
     description: "Plan risky upgrade",
     prompt: "Task description: Upgrade [component] from [current] to [target] in this repo.
     Classification: [SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK] — reason: [routing trigger]
     Upgrade plan: [paste the READY planner handoff]
     Current state: branch = [git branch], uncommitted = [git status --short summary]

     Before writing the plan, grep the repo for import sites and usage patterns of this component to understand blast radius, migration order, test coverage, and rollback."
   )
   ```

   If the planner returns `### Re-classification`, surface it and let the user accept the down-classification, override it, or cancel the component.

7. **Confirm the full plan** — Present the resolved component list, classifications, related upgrades, and any Opus plans. Do not touch files until approved.

---

## Phase 2 — Execution (after user confirms)

### Phase 2 prep (once)

1. **Create feature branch**
   - Run `git status --porcelain`. If dirty, show the diff summary and ask whether to stash, proceed anyway, or cancel.
   - Generate `chore/upgrade-<component>-to-<version>` for a single component, or `chore/upgrade-<first>-and-<N>-more` for a batch. Match the repo's existing prefix convention when obvious.
   - If HEAD is on a non-default branch with ahead commits, ask whether to branch from current position, branch from default, or cancel.
   - Run `git checkout -b <branch-name>`. If it exists, append `-<7-char-sha>`.

2. **Capture baseline tests** — Invoke the existing test baseline agent once and reuse the result for the entire batch:

   ```
   task(
     agent_type: "dev-workflows:test-baseliner",
     model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`,
     description: "Capture test baseline",
     prompt: "Mode: capture
     Project root: [absolute repo path]"
   )
   ```

   Store the returned baseline; do not re-run baseline capture per component.

### Per-component loop (sequential, in requested order)

3. **Delegate execution** — For each `READY` plan, invoke the executor agent with the planner handoff and the captured baseline.

   ```
   task(
     agent_type: "dev-workflows:upgrade-executor",
     model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain — for SIMPLE/MODERATE; planning_model — §2 Opus chain — only if HIGH-RISK>`,
     description: "Execute component upgrade",
     prompt: "## Upgrade Execution Request
     repo: [absolute repo path]
     phase: full
     baseline:
       passing_count: [captured count]
       passing_tests:
         - [captured test ids]
     model_routing:
       classification: [component class]
       reason: <one-line>
       current_model: <the model this orchestrator is running under>
       detection_model: <§2.1 detection chain: claude-sonnet-4.6, fallback claude-sonnet-4.5/gpt-5.4>   # upgrade-planner, test-baseliner; upgrade-executor (SIMPLE/MODERATE); review-fixer
       planning_model: <§2 Opus chain>   # risk-planner (SIGNIFICANT/HIGH-RISK; frontmatter-pinned, recorded, no override); upgrade-executor escalates here only if HIGH-RISK
       review_model:  <§2 Opus chain>    # code-review (frontmatter-pinned; recorded, no override)
       opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
       gate_tests_on_review: [true for SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK, false otherwise]
       notes: <any §2 / §2.1 fallback or degradation>

     [paste the full READY upgrade plan verbatim]"
   )
   ```

4. **Review gate for SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK** — If the executor returns `status: AWAITING_REVIEW`, run the Opus code-review gate before any test verification:
   - Capture the diff with `git add -N . && git diff`
   - Invoke `code-review` using the approved risk plan, the executor output, and the diff (frontmatter-pinned to Opus; recorded as `review_model` above, no `model:` override needed)
   - If review returns `BLOCK` or `PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS`, invoke `review-fixer` with model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>` for `BLOCKER` and `MAJOR` findings, then re-run the Opus review once
   - If the second verdict is still `BLOCK`, stop and escalate; do not continue to tests

5. **Resume verify step after review** — Re-invoke `upgrade-executor` with `phase: verify-resume`, the original `READY` plan, and the same baseline block captured in Phase 2 prep.

6. **Collect results** — Accumulate one summary row per component. Preserve the classification, review verdict, related upgrades applied, and any regression notes.

7. **Post-batch maintenance** — After all components finish, invoke `impl-maintenance` with a compact session handoff summarising what was upgraded, key failures or workarounds, and the overall result.

**Context hygiene.** This was a large run — consider **`/compact`** to free context before your next task (per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md` §3 — non-pipeline, so `/compact` only; guidance only).

8. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic)** — After `impl-maintenance` returns, project its plugin-facing slice into the specs repo by citing `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md` and calling its `emit-auto` entry point (§6). Pass the Lessons Learned report, `command: upgrade:`, the run's `jira_key` (or `null`) and `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/.plugin/plugin.json`). `emit-auto` renders only the report's **Command workflow improvements**, **New agents / skills**, and plugin **Reference docs** sections plus the **Key observations** that triggered them (§4 plugin-facing predicate) — never target-project `copilot-instructions.md`/hook advice — as `origin: auto` entries, dedupes by stable `id` (§3), resolves the target via the §2 specs-first ladder, and writes silently. List the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted") after the lessons-learned report. ADDITIVE — this step NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits, and NEVER writes into the code repo or the current working directory.

## Version Resolution

| Token | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `component:1.2.3` | Use exact version; verify it exists; run compatibility check; surface conflicts (never silently downgrade) |
| `component:minor` | Latest stable patch within current `MAJOR.MINOR.*` |
| `component:latest` | Highest stable release; run compatibility check |
| `component:lts` | Consult official LTS source (see `lts-sources.md`); if lookup fails, ask the user |
| bare `component` | Highest version compatible with all other repo components; report conflict if none found |

---

## Output

```
## Upgrade Summary

| Component  | Before | After  | Class       | Review | Status  | Notes                       |
|------------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|---------|-----------------------------|
| springboot | 3.1.4  | 3.3.11 | HIGH-RISK   | PASS   | OK      | Also upgraded hibernate 6.4 |
| java       | 17     | 21     | SIGNIFICANT | PASS W/RECS | OK | Updated 2 test files        |
| commons-text | 1.10 | 1.11   | MODERATE    | N/A    | OK      |                             |
| redis      | -      | -      | -           | -      | SKIPPED | Not found in project        |

Tests: 142 passed, 0 regressions (baseline: 142 passing)
```

Include the `impl-maintenance` lessons-learned report after the summary table.

---

## Invariants (always enforced)

- ALWAYS `emit-block` (per `references/feedback-emission.md`) before escalating a halt caused by a **plugin / skill / command / reference gap** (a capability the run needed but the plugin lacked) — so a run abandoned at the block still records it. NEVER for a work-quality review BLOCK or an environment / user halt (repo-missing, dirty-tree, jira-not-found, cancellation)
- NEVER skip per-component classification after planning
- NEVER use Opus for a `MODERATE` component unless the user explicitly asks for it
- NEVER run tests for a `SIGNIFICANT` / `HIGH-RISK` component before the Opus review returns a non-BLOCK verdict
- NEVER modify files during Phase 1
- NEVER touch files before the upgrade branch exists
- ALWAYS capture the baseline once before executing any component
- ALWAYS pass the same baseline block to `upgrade-executor` on `phase: verify-resume`
- ALWAYS include classification in the final summary table
- After the run, suggest **`/compact`** (a big non-pipeline run) per `references/session-hygiene.md` §3 — compact-only, no clear/resume pointer; guidance only, never auto-run.
