Author an Architecture Requirements/Decision Document for the Jira item: the argument (text following the `create-ard:` trigger)

`create-ard:` is **sub-project 3 of the VI-creation flow** — the **Product Architect (PA)** phase. It
grounds on the mounted implementation repos and authors an **ARD** that establishes the architecture
invariants the downstream (`specify:`, `design:`, `implement:`) will later inherit. The ARD is
**optional** (a simple VI may not need one) and **scoped** via the two-key grammar:

- `create-ard: <VI-KEY>` → a **VI-level** ARD.
- `create-ard: <VI-KEY> <Epic-KEY>` → an **Epic-level** ARD (inherits the VI-level ARD read-only).

It authors architecture only — no code writing; grounding is **architect-driven** (there are no PRs at
this stage). Zero Jira API.

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve input
1. **Resolve the Jira input** via `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/jira-input-resolution.md` against the argument (text following the `create-ard:` trigger) → `jira_key` (the VI), `focus_key` (the Epic, or `null`), `jira_export_root`, `source`. Define `<VI>` = `jira_key`, `<EPIC>` = `focus_key`.
2. **`$SPECS_PATH` (required).** If unset, stop naming `SPECS_PATH` (`choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]`).
3. **Feature folder.** VI-level → `specifications/<VI>-<vslug>/`; Epic-level → `specifications/<VI>-<vslug>/<EPIC>-<eslug>/`. Honor an existing dir matched by key-number (tolerate `-`/`_` drift). Auto-created on first write.
4. **Prior ARD.** If the target `*_ARD.md` exists → Phase 1 offers refine-vs-fresh.
5. **Optionality advisory.** Gauge size — the VI's user-story count / scope breadth / number of candidate repos. For a small, single-repo VI, note "an ARD may be optional here" and offer `choices: ["Author the ARD anyway", "Stop — no ARD needed", "Other… (describe)"]`.

`create-ard:` is **cwd-agnostic**; it reads the VI/Epic and scans repos under `$REPOS_PATH`.

---

## Phase 1 — Configure
Use `choices` arrays; the last choice is always `"Other… (describe)"`.
1. **Confirm** the scope (VI-level vs Epic-level) and the feature folder.
2. **Refine vs fresh** (only if a prior `*_ARD.md` exists): `choices: ["Refine the existing ARD (Recommended)", "Start fresh — overwrite", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`.
3. **Repos search base (`$REPOS_PATH`).** Read `${REPOS_PATH:-/workspace}` (may be colon-separated): `choices: ["Use $REPOS_PATH (default /workspace) (Recommended)", "Use a different path (you'll be prompted)", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`.
4. **Repo refresh policy** (governs Phase 3's `code-scanner`): `choices: ["fetch + pull default branch (Recommended)", "fetch only", "no refresh", "Other… (describe)"]`.

---

## Phase 1.5 — Classify + model routing
Load and follow the model-routing policy at
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md`, then record:

```yaml
model_routing:
  classification: MODERATE | SIGNIFICANT | HIGH-RISK   # architecture; SIGNIFICANT common for cross-repo VIs
  reason: <one-line>
  current_model: <the model this orchestrator/grill is running under>
  detection_model: <§2.1 detection chain: claude-sonnet-4.6, fallback claude-sonnet-4.5/gpt-5.4>   # jira-reader, code-scanner, impl-maintenance
  review_model:    <§2 Opus chain>     # ard-reviewer (caller-pinned; recorded)
  authoring_model: <= current_model>   # the interactive grill + ARD authoring (session model, not a delegated subagent)
  opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
  notes: <any §2/§2.1 fallback or degradation>
```

**Tiered HARD model gate (like `design:`):** for `SIGNIFICANT` / `HIGH-RISK`, require an Opus session — if `opus_available` is false, stop: `choices: ["I'll relaunch create-ard: on Opus (Recommended)", "Override — proceed on the current model (logged in the final report)", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`. For `SIMPLE`/`MODERATE`, degradation is advisory (record in `notes`).

---

## Phase 2 — Read the VI (+ Epic, + inherited ARD)
Read the VI from `$SPECS_PATH/specifications/<VI>-<vslug>/<VI>_ValueIncrement.md` when present (authored source); else dispatch `jira-reader` to read it from the export:

→ task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:jira-reader", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
  > "Return the structured handoff for this brief:
  >
  > jira_export_root: [resolved jira_export_root]
  > jira_key:         [<VI> for a VI-level run, <EPIC> for an Epic-level run]
  > depth:            vi-only (VI-level) | full (Epic-level, scoped to focus_key)"

For an **Epic-level** run always dispatch `jira-reader` this way (`depth: full`, scoped to `focus_key`) for the Epic's scope — the authored-VI-file check above only applies VI-level. If a `<VI>_ARD.md` exists load its `AD-N` invariants to **inherit read-only**.

Extract the problem/goal/scope frame + capability themes — the raw material for grounding + the grill.

---

## Phase 3 — Architect-driven grounding (no PRs)
There are no PRs at ARD time, so repos are **architect-driven**, not PR-derived:
1. **Cheap discovery.** List the top-level directories under each `$REPOS_PATH` entry (`ls`). Optionally attach each dir's one-line identity — `timeout 5 git -C <dir> remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null` (slug) or its README first heading. Do **not** deep-scan to guess relevance.
2. **Propose + ask.** From the VI/Epic themes, propose a `theme → repo` mapping against those dirs, and **ask the architect to confirm / correct / add**. For any requirement that maps to no obvious repo, **ask outright**: "which repo covers `<X>`?"
3. **Missing repo → consolidated mount-or-descope gate:** `choices: ["Mount now & re-scan", "Ground only the confirmed-mounted set (record the rest as open questions)", "Specify an absolute path for this repo", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`.
4. **Ground the confirmed set.** Spawn `code-scanner` in batches of up to 4 concurrent agents per Agent message on the confirmed repos (wait for each batch), scoped by the themes:

   → task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:code-scanner", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
     > "repo_path: <resolved absolute path>
     >  repo_url_slug: <slug>
     >  capability_themes: [themes]
     >  context: |
     >    [3–5 sentences: the VI/Epic goal, what the ARD must ground]
     >  search_hints: { symbols: […], paths: […], keywords: […] }
     >  refresh: { switch_to_default_branch: [per Phase 1], pull: [per Phase 1] }"

   Store the per-repo as-is findings (`file:line`). Descoped/unmounted repos become Open questions.

---

## Phase 4 — Author via grill
**Interview technique (grilling — embedded; no runtime dependency).** Conduct a **relentless** interview per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/grilling-technique.md` — one question at a time, recommend each answer, explore the Phase 3 grounding findings / the VI to self-answer (fact-vs-decision), walk the design tree in dependency order, continue to shared understanding then write each section.

Author the ARD live against `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/ard-format.md` at the resolved altitude: Context → Grounding findings (cite `file:line`) → Architecture decisions (`AD-N`: Binds/Prevents/Rule) → Cross-repo/component approach → Stack & invariants → Edge cases & risks → Open questions → Deferred. At Epic level, list inherited VI-level ADs read-only and never contradict them; VI level stays at invariants/frame (no per-repo detailed solutions).

**Per-area split.** If (Epic level) the confirmed grounding spans separable areas in one repo (e.g. `server/` backend + `ui/` frontend), grill: `choices: ["One combined ARD (Recommended)", "One ARD per area (backend / frontend / …)", "Other… (describe)"]`. On per-area, author one `<EPIC>-<area>_ARD.md` per area (each with its own `area:` frontmatter).

---

## Phase 4.5 — Structural pre-lint

Before the review gate, run the deterministic checks in
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/pre-lint.md` against the drafted `*_ARD.md`: the **Universal checks**
plus the **ARD** block (incl. that every `### [AD-N]` carries `**Binds:**` / `**Prevents:**` /
`**Rule:**`). Surface every finding; inline-fix the mechanical ones (renumber a duplicate `[AD-N]`,
delete a stray placeholder token); leave content gaps for the grill/author. **Advisory** — never blocks;
proceed to Phase 5 once findings are surfaced. `ard-reviewer` remains the gate.

## Phase 5 — Review gate
Dispatch `ard-reviewer` (Opus, caller-pinned; recorded as `review_model`):

→ task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:ard-reviewer", model: `<review_model — §2 Opus chain>`):
  > "Review the ARD:
  >
  > ARD path: [absolute path to the *_ARD.md]
  > Scope: [vi | epic]"

On `BLOCK`, fix the BLOCKER findings inline (the orchestrator/grill edits the ARD — no delegated writer) and re-review **once**; if still `BLOCK`, escalate per the `Review verdict BLOCK` rule in `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/escalation-rules.md`. `PASS` / `PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS` → proceed. Cap: one fix cycle + one re-review. (For a per-area split, review each area ARD.)

---

## Phase 6 — Handoff
Write the ARD file(s) into the feature folder. Then **offer** (commit-when-asked — never automatic): `choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git", "Cancel"]`. Branch `ard/<VI>-<vslug>` (VI-level) or `ard/<EPIC>-<eslug>` (Epic-level); commit ONLY the feature folder (never `git add -A`); push; open a PR targeting `main`. Commit trailer: `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>`.

---

## Phase 7 — Next-step offer (adaptive)
- **VI-level ARD:** if the VI has 0 Epics → `choices: ["Hand to a Product Engineer — epics: <VI> (then create them in Jira + re-import) (PE) (Recommended)", "Author a VI-level spec — specify: <VI> (PE)", "Stop here", "Other… (describe)"]`; else offer `specify: <VI>` (PE). *(No `design:` — no Epics yet.)*
- **Epic-level ARD:** `choices: ["Author the spec — specify: <VI> <Epic> (PE) (Recommended)", "Hand to the team — design: <VI> <Epic> (Team)", "Stop here", "Other… (describe)"]`. **Epic fan-out** — repeat this ARD for a sibling Epic: `create-ard: <VI> <another-Epic>`.

Guidance only — never auto-invokes another command. Per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/next-phase-offer.md`.

### Context hygiene

Write the resume pointer at `<VI-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md` (per `session-hygiene.md`
§1). The next step hands off from PA to PE/Team, so:

- **Handing to PE (`epics: <VI>` / `specify: <VI> <Epic>`) or Team (`design: <VI> <Epic>`), even yourself?** → run **`/clear`** for a clean slate; the ARD is on disk.
- Continuing to draft more ARD areas yourself right now? → **`/compact`** is fine.
- Consider **`/rename <VI-ID>-<slug>-pa`** so you can find this session later.

Guidance only — see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md`.

---

## Phase 8 — Session maintenance & feedback
Terminal phase — runs after Phase 7, NEVER interrupts an earlier phase.

**Capture-at-block invariant.** If an EARLIER phase **halts on a plugin / skill / command / reference gap**, `emit-block` (per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md`) at that halt **before** escalating. NEVER `emit-block` for an environment / user halt (unset `$SPECS_PATH`, missing key, no-ARD-needed, unmounted-repo descope, cancellation) or a review BLOCK.

**Session-hygiene invariant.** End Phase 7 with a `### Context hygiene` block per
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md` — prepare-first (`resume.md`), then a
PA→PE/Team handoff suggestion (`/clear`) + `/rename <VI-ID>-<slug>-pa`. Guidance only, never auto-run.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (agent_type: "dev-workflows:impl-maintenance", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`) with a compact handoff: command `create-ard:`; what was authored (ARD scope + grounded repos); key events (grounding gaps/descopes, BLOCK reviews — or 'none'); workarounds; the `ard-reviewer` verdict; test result N/A; project root = the feature folder.
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Cite `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md` and call its `emit-auto` entry point (§6) with the report, `command: create-ard:`, the run's `jira_key`, `source`, and `plugin_version` (read from `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/.plugin/plugin.json`). Surface the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing persisted").

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits (git is offered only in Phase 6), and NEVER writes into a code/docs repo or the current working directory; no user name is ever written.

## Final report
Report: the ARD path(s) + scope (VI/Epic, any per-area split); the grounded repos + any descoped/ungrounded ones; `AD-N` count; open-question count; the `ard-reviewer` verdict; the PR URL (if opened); resolved model routing (+ any Opus gate/degradation); the feedback path; and the adaptive next-step recommendation.
