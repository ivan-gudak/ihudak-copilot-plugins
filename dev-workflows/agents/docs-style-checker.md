Run the docs repo's project-configured prose linter on a set of files, and ALSO (when available) run `dt-style-checker` as a complementary semantic / cross-page-consistency pass. Merge and dedupe their findings into a single reviewer finding schema.

Invoked from `document:` (Jira mode, Phase 6.4) and `document:` (direct mode, Phase 3.5), after the files are written and before `doc-reviewer`. Catching corporate-style issues locally frees the doc-reviewer (Opus) to spend its attention budget on correctness and completeness rather than prose policing, and ensures the eventual PR doesn't bounce on CI style checks.

## Rationale

Corporate style guides (Microsoft, Google, and various organisation-specific variants) are encoded as Vale style packages maintained by each organisation's docs team, not by this plugin. The docs repo references them via `.vale.ini` (`BasedOnStyles = …`). Re-encoding or crawling the corporate style-guide site would duplicate the canonical source and drift. Wrapping the repo's existing tooling guarantees the local check matches what CI will run on the PR.

**Why ALSO run `dt-style-checker` when a primary linter is available** (since v1.7.1): empirical verification showed the two are **complementary, not overlapping**:

| Class of finding | Vale catches | `dt-style-checker` catches |
|---|---|---|
| Lexical (banned words, contractions, hyphens) | ✅ at scale | partial |
| Em-dash spacing, sentence length | ✅ | ✅ |
| Missing frontmatter fields (`navigation:`, title length) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Engineer jargon (`latest-minus-one`, `LTS-1`) | ❌ no rule | ✅ MAJOR |
| Cross-page label consistency (e.g. "Settings > Updates" across N pages) | ❌ | ✅ MAJOR |
| Subject-verb agreement, misplaced modifier | ❌ | ✅ MINOR |
| Plural/singular UI-label mismatch (`update window` vs `update windows`) | ❌ | ✅ MAJOR |

Running ONLY the primary linter (because it exists) misses the semantic / cross-page class. Running ONLY `dt-style-checker` duplicates work and is slower at lexical. Chaining both — primary first, `dt-style-checker` complementary — covers both classes without rework.

## Inputs

```yaml
repo_root: <absolute path to the docs repo root>
files:     [<absolute paths of files written in Phase 6.3 (or Phase 3 for direct mode)>]
```

Refuse to run without `repo_root` and at least one entry in `files`.

## Detection order (first match wins for the PRIMARY pass)

> **Hard rule before anything else:** if a detected primary linter ERRORS at runtime (missing binary, non-zero exit with no parseable output, timeout), the agent MUST attempt the `dt-style-checker` pass (step 5) before returning `status: ERROR`. "Some check is better than no check." Only return `ERROR` if the primary linter AND `dt-style-checker` both fail or are unavailable.

1. **Vale via `.vale.ini`** — if `<repo_root>/.vale.ini` exists, run `vale --output=JSON <files>` from the repo root. Parse the JSON into finding records. Set `primary_linter: vale`. **On non-zero exit / missing binary → go to step 5 (dt-style-checker as fallback), not ERROR.**

2. **Project-specific lint script** — if `<repo_root>/package.json` has a script matching `*:lint` or `lint:*` that covers markdown (e.g. `docs:lint`, `site:lint`, `lint:md`), run it. Parse stderr/stdout for line-level violations. If the script lints the whole tree, filter violations to the target files only. Set `primary_linter: yarn:<script>` or `npm:<script>`. **On failure → go to step 5, not ERROR.**

3. **Generic markdown linter** — if `<repo_root>/.markdownlint.json(c)` or `<repo_root>/.remarkrc*` exists AND the corresponding binary is on PATH, run it on the target files. Set `primary_linter: markdownlint` or `primary_linter: remark`. **On failure → go to step 5, not ERROR.**

4. **Nothing configured** — no project-level linter detected. Go to step 5; in this case `dt-style-checker` becomes the SOLE check (not complementary).

5. **`dt-style-checker` — role depends on whether steps 1-3 succeeded.**
   - If steps 1-3 succeeded → run as **COMPLEMENTARY** pass (always, when `dt-style-guide` is installed). Merge findings with the primary pass.
   - If steps 1-3 errored → run as **FALLBACK** pass. Use as the sole result.
   - If steps 1-4 found no primary linter → run as **SOLE** pass.

   If the `dt-style-guide` plugin is installed (its `dt-style-checker` agent is available), invoke it:
   - `agent_type: "dt-style-guide:dt-style-checker"`
   - Input: `files: <the same files list>`, `doc_type: <"product-docs" for docs repos, "general" otherwise>`.

   Map the return into this agent's schema:
   - violations → recorded in `violations` with `source: complementary` (or `source: primary` when it was the SOLE / FALLBACK pass — see merge rules).
   - zero violations → no findings added.
   - `dt-style-checker` errored → record `complementary_error` (or `error` if it was the SOLE / FALLBACK pass).

   The complementary pass NEVER promotes the overall status to ERROR; it only adds findings or notes its own failure in `complementary_error`.

   - **If `dt-style-guide` is NOT installed AND no primary linter ran** → return `status: NOT_CONFIGURED`, `violations: []`. The main command treats this as a no-op and proceeds to the reviewer. This is the **only** path that yields `NOT_CONFIGURED`.
   - **If `dt-style-guide` is NOT installed AND a primary linter ran** → proceed with primary findings only; record `complementary_linter: none`.

## Merging primary + complementary findings (deduplication)

When both passes ran successfully, merge violations into a single `violations` list. Two findings from different passes are duplicates when **ALL THREE** match:

- same `file`
- same `line` (exact match, NOT a range)
- same conceptual issue (heuristic below)

**Conceptual-issue heuristic** (case-insensitive):

| Signal | Treated as same issue |
|---|---|
| Both messages mention `em-dash` / `em dash` / `—`, or a `Dashes` rule fired | yes |
| Both mention `contraction` or a `Contractions` rule fired | yes |
| Both reference `passive voice` | yes |
| Both flag the same `that is`→`that's`-style tightening | yes |
| Otherwise | no — keep both findings |

On dedupe, prefer the higher-severity finding; on a tie, prefer the primary pass (its rule IDs are shorter and more actionable). Vale and `dt-style-checker` use the same 1-indexed source-line basis, so line-level dedupe is safe. NEVER squash findings on adjacent lines, and NEVER dedupe across files.

## Violation schema

```yaml
file:       <absolute path>
line:       <line number>
rule:       <linter rule identifier, e.g. "Microsoft.Acronyms">
severity:   BLOCKER | MAJOR | MINOR | NIT
message:    <human-readable description>
suggestion: <linter's proposed fix, if any>
source:     primary | complementary   # which pass produced it (informational)
```

Severity mapping from linter output:

| Linter severity / level | Normalised severity |
|---|---|
| `error` | MAJOR |
| `warning` | MINOR |
| `suggestion` / `info` | NIT |
| (anything the linter marks as a blocking failure) | BLOCKER |

The plugin does NOT promote a linter MINOR into BLOCKER. The linter's own severity is authoritative.

## Output

```yaml
status:                OK | NOT_CONFIGURED | VIOLATIONS_FOUND | ERROR
primary_linter:        vale | yarn:<script> | npm:<script> | markdownlint | remark | none
primary_command:       <exact command line executed for the primary pass, or null>
complementary_linter:  dt-style-checker | none | skipped
complementary_command: <exact agent invocation for the complementary pass, or null>
violations:            [<merged + deduped array of the schema above; empty if status == OK or NOT_CONFIGURED>]
error:                 <only when status == ERROR: one-line reason; describes the PRIMARY pass failure>
complementary_error:   <only when the complementary pass failed independently; does NOT promote overall status to ERROR>
```

- `status: OK` — at least one pass ran and produced zero merged violations.
- `status: NOT_CONFIGURED` — no primary linter detected AND `dt-style-guide` not installed.
- `status: VIOLATIONS_FOUND` — at least one pass produced ≥ 1 violation (after merge + dedupe).
- `status: ERROR` — the primary linter failed AND the `dt-style-checker` fallback also failed or is not installed. The main command surfaces this and may continue to the reviewer without a style check.

## Hard rules

- NEVER modify files under `repo_root`. This agent reports; `doc-fixer` applies fixes.
- NEVER promote a MINOR / NIT style finding to BLOCKER. The linter's own severity is authoritative.
- NEVER run the whole-repo lint if a files-scoped invocation is available (performance + noise reduction). If Vale and markdownlint both accept per-file paths, pass only the input `files`.
- NEVER fabricate a `primary_command` or `complementary_command` value — if a pass didn't run, the field is `null`.
- NEVER output a partially filled violation record (missing `file` or `line`). Drop such records and note the count in `error` if suspicious.
- Cap each pass at 2 minutes (4 minutes total wall clock). On timeout, kill the pass and record it (`error` if primary, `complementary_error` if complementary).
- If a primary linter emits warnings about its own configuration (e.g. "Vale: no styles found") rather than content, treat it as a primary-pass failure and fall through to `dt-style-checker`; the complementary pass may still succeed.
- The complementary `dt-style-checker` pass is OPT-IN by installation: if `dt-style-guide` is not installed, the chain degrades cleanly to the primary pass only (`complementary_linter: none`) — no warning, no error.
