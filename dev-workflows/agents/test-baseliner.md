Run the project's full test suite and return a structured result for regression comparison.

Operates in two modes. The caller must specify which mode to use.

---

## Mode: capture

Run the test suite and return a baseline snapshot. Use this **before** making changes.

### Steps

1. **Detect framework** — Search the working directory for build/config files in this order:
   - `pom.xml` → Maven, command: `mvn test -q`
   - `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` → Gradle, command: `./gradlew test` (fall back to `gradle test` if no wrapper)
   - `package.json` → read the `scripts.test` field; if absent, use `npm test`. Check for a `workspaces` field — if present, use `npm test --workspaces --if-present`.
   - `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `pytest.ini` → pytest, command: `pytest -v`
   - `Makefile` containing a `test` target → `make test`
   - If no framework found: return the structure below with Framework = "not detected", all counts = 0, and a note explaining no runner was found. Do not fail.

2. **Run** — Execute the detected command. Allow up to 10 minutes. Capture stdout and stderr combined.

3. **Parse** — Extract from the output:

   | Framework | Passing count | Failing count | Skipped count |
   |-----------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
   | Maven | `Tests run: X` minus failures+errors per module, summed | `Failures: Y, Errors: Z` summed | `Skipped: N` summed |
   | Gradle | `X tests completed` minus failed | `, Y failed` | `, Z skipped` |
   | pytest | `X passed` | `Y failed` or `Y error` | `N skipped` |
   | Jest/npm | `X passed` | `Y failed` | `Y skipped` |
   | Make | best-effort: look for any `X passed` / `X failed` / `X pass` / `X fail` patterns. If no pattern is found, set counts to 0 and include a note. | same | same |

   Also collect the names/identifiers of every passing test and every failing test from the verbose output.

4. **Return this exact structure and nothing else:**

```markdown
## Test Baseline
- **Mode**: capture
- **Framework**: [name or "not detected"]
- **Command**: `[command used]`
- **Total**: [n] | **Passing**: [n] | **Failing**: [n] | **Skipped**: [n]

### Pre-existing failures
[one test identifier per line — or "none"]

### Passing tests
[one test identifier per line]
```

---

## Mode: verify

Re-run the test suite and diff against a previously captured baseline. Use this **after** making changes to detect regressions.

### Inputs

The caller must provide:
- The full baseline block from a prior `capture` run (the `## Test Baseline` markdown block)
- The project root path

### Steps

1. **Detect framework** — Same detection logic as capture mode.

2. **Sanity check** — If the detected framework or command differs from the baseline, return:
   ```
   Comparison status: invalid
   Reason: framework changed from [baseline framework] to [current framework]. Manual comparison required.
   ```
   Do not run the test suite.

3. **Run** — Execute the detected command. Allow up to 10 minutes. Capture stdout and stderr combined. If the run aborts (non-zero exit, truncated output, or unrecognized runner output), set `Comparison status: best-effort` and note the issue.

4. **Parse** — Same patterns as capture mode.

5. **Diff against baseline** — Compare using the test identifiers from the baseline's `### Passing tests` list:

   | Category | Definition |
   |----------|-----------|
   | **Regressions** | Was in baseline `### Passing tests` AND is now failing |
   | **Missing from run** | Was in baseline `### Passing tests` AND is not present in the current run at all (treat as regression-severity — test may have been silently dropped or suite aborted early) |
   | **Newly fixed** | Was in baseline `### Pre-existing failures` AND is now passing |
   | **New failures** | Is failing now AND was not in baseline `### Pre-existing failures` AND was not in baseline `### Passing tests` (new test added and already failing) |

6. **Return this exact structure and nothing else:**

```markdown
## Test Verify Report
- **Mode**: verify
- **Framework**: [name]
- **Command**: `[command used]`
- **Comparison status**: [exact | best-effort | invalid]
- **Total**: [n] | **Passing**: [n] | **Failing**: [n] | **Skipped**: [n]
- **Baseline passing**: [n from baseline] | **Regressions**: [n] | **Missing from run**: [n]

### Regressions (previously passing, now failing)
[one test identifier per line — or "none"]

### Missing from run (previously passing, not present in current run)
[one test identifier per line — or "none"]

### Newly fixed (previously failing, now passing)
[one test identifier per line — or "none"]

### New failures (new tests that are already failing)
[one test identifier per line — or "none"]

### Notes
[any parser confidence issues, aborted runs, or "none"]

### Current passing tests
[one test identifier per line — for chaining further verify calls against the same original baseline]
