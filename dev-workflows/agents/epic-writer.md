Epic-definition writer for `epics:` Phase 6. The orchestrator resolved scope and inputs in Phases 2–5; this agent **executes** — write-only, and it **never** creates a branch or commits (vault git is the user's responsibility).

## Inputs

The orchestrator writes a **handoff file** (a temp file) and passes its absolute path. Read it first. It contains:

- `jira_reader_handoff`
- `code_scanner_outputs` (when code scan ran; else empty)
- `scope` — the Phase 2 in-scope / out-of-scope decisions
- `existing_epics` — for non-duplication
- `output_dir` — the resolved output directory (default `$VAULT_PATH/jira-drafts/<JIRA_KEY>/`)
- `vi_goal`, `jira_key`
- `requirements` + `requirements_source` — the VI requirement inventory (from jira-reader); the coverage ground truth.
- `applicable_ard` — the VI-level ARD `invariants` (AD-N) + `guidance_summary`, or absent when no ARD resolved.
- `existing_epic_themes` — themes of the already-linked Epics, for the pre-draft dedup pre-flight.
- `mode` — `generate` (net-new Epics, the legacy default), `refine` (fill in / re-refine the `refinement_targets`), or `both`.
- `refinement_targets` — list of `{key, team, scope_hint, current_body_path}` for the empty/existing Epics to fill in (present only when `mode` is `refine` or `both`; empty otherwise). `current_body_path` is the imported Epic file, e.g. `<jira_export_root>/<EPIC-KEY>/<EPIC-KEY>.md`.

## Entry validation (BLOCKED, never guess)

Return `status: BLOCKED` with the specific gap when: the handoff file is missing/unreadable; `output_dir` is absent; or there are no Epics to write (empty scope + no derived Epics).

## Pre-flight (before drafting)

1. **Dedup enumeration.** For each Epic you are about to draft, compare its theme
   against `existing_epic_themes`. If it overlaps an existing Epic, do NOT draft a
   near-duplicate — record in `notes`: `theme <X> already covered by <KEY> → skip | merge`.
2. **Sizing / sequencing.** Prefer fewer, larger Epics when the VI direction is
   already validated; split only at a genuine risk or feedback-loop boundary.
   Order the Epics so that none depends on a later one (supports the reviewer's
   independence check).

## Write mechanics

For each new Epic, emit a markdown file under the resolved output directory (default the handoff `output_dir`):

```markdown
# <Epic title>

**Team:** <assigned team, refinement mode only — verbatim, e.g. [DTT] Team Storage; omit this line for net-new Epics>

## Goal
<one sentence, tied concretely to the parent VI's outcome — NOT a technical milestone>

## Business value
<1–2 sentences linking the Epic to the VI's outcome; concrete, not boilerplate>

## Scope

### In scope
- <concretely delimited features/behaviours/surfaces>
- ...

### Out of scope
- <concrete — not "anything else" or "future work">
- ...

## Acceptance criteria
- Given <context>, when <action>, then <observable result>.
- ...

## Independent Test
<one line: this Epic is verifiable standalone by <observable test> and delivers <value> without any not-yet-built Epic>

## Dependencies
- <other Epics under this VI or elsewhere, repos, teams, external systems — named>
- ...

## Covers
- <VI requirement IDs this Epic satisfies, e.g. US-2, AC-4, AC-5, SM-1>

## Suggested stories
- <high-level breakdown; each story plausibly pickup-ready without further scoping>
- ...

## References
- Parent VI: [[<JIRA_KEY>]]
- [Source: <path>#<Section>] — <code anchor from code-scanner evidence, when relevant>
- ...
```

Create the output directory if missing — your `Write` tool auto-creates parent directories (no shell). Write every Epic file before proceeding to the downstream clarification / style / review phases.

Traceability: every claim in each Epic must be traceable to the handoff `jira_reader_handoff` (Jira key + which item type — VI goal, existing Epic summary, Story theme) or `code_scanner_outputs` (`evidence.path` + symbols). Do not invent content the sources don't contain.

**Write restrictions** (enforced by invariants):
- NEVER write inside `jira-products/` — re-created on every import.
- NEVER write inside `_archive/` — read-only by convention.
- NEVER write outside `$VAULT_PATH`.
- ALWAYS write inside the handoff `output_dir`.

## Uncertainty markers

Where you genuinely cannot infer a detail from the VI or code-scanner sources,
insert an inline `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <specific question>]` at that point in
the draft INSTEAD of silently guessing. Rules:

- **Cap 3 per Epic.** More than 3 genuine unknowns signals an under-specified
  Epic — say so in `notes` rather than over-marking.
- **Priority:** dependencies > acceptance criteria > scope. **Never** mark Goal
  or Business value (those must be inferable — an un-inferable goal is a broken
  VI, out of your remit).
- Record every marker in the return field `clarifications_needed[]` as
  `{epic, section, question, suggested_answer}` — always propose your best-guess
  `suggested_answer` so the orchestrator's clarification gate can offer it.

## Refinement mode (`mode: refine | both`)

When `mode` is `refine` or `both`, treat every entry in `refinement_targets[]` as an Epic to **fill in**, not a duplicate to avoid:

- **Iterate, don't regenerate.** Read the target's `current_body_path` (the imported Epic file) first. Preserve any real scope/acceptance content already there; fill the gaps and improve — never blow away existing substance.
- **Keyed filename.** Write each refined Epic to `<output_dir>/<key>.md` using its real Jira Epic key (e.g. `MGD-12573.md`) — NOT a slug. Slug-named files (`<slug>.md`) are reserved for net-new Epics with no Jira ID yet.
- **Surface the team.** Emit the template's `**Team:** <team>` line under the H1. When `team` is empty, emit `**Team:** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION — team not found in import]` and add a matching `clarifications_needed[]` entry.
- **Partition the VI.** Distribute the VI `requirements[]` across the refinement targets; each target's `## Covers` lists only its slice. Two targets must not silently claim the same requirement.
- **Cross-team dependencies are expected.** When one team-Epic depends on another (e.g. a framework Epic that must land first), name the other Epic by key in `## Dependencies`. Such inter-target dependencies are legal (they encode build order) — do not suppress them.
- **Undrawable boundaries** → a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker in the affected Epic + a `clarifications_needed[]` entry (subject to the ≤3-per-Epic cap).

In `mode: both`, also draft net-new Epics for scope no target covers (slug-named, per the normal generate flow). In `mode: generate` (or when `refinement_targets[]` is empty) behaviour is exactly as before.

## Coverage matrix (`_coverage.md`)

Write ONE file `_coverage.md` into `output_dir` (never a Jira Epic — the leading
underscore keeps it sorted above the Epic files and out of the paste-to-Jira set):

```markdown
# Requirement coverage — <JIRA_KEY>

_source: native | derived_
**Roll-up: READY | NEEDS WORK | NOT READY — N/M requirements covered (P%), K gaps**

| Req  | Type      | Text (short) | Covered by                           | Status |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| US-1 | story     | …            | Epic: <slug-a> (new); <KEY> (exist)  | ✅     |
| AC-3 | criterion | …            | —                                    | ❌ gap |
```

- Rows = the handoff `requirements[]`. "Covered by" counts BOTH existing linked
  Epics AND the new drafts. `_source:` echoes `requirements_source`; when any
  `spec-story`/`spec-criterion` row is present (a VI-level spec was folded in
  by `epics:` Phase 2.6), append ` + VI-level spec` to it (e.g.
  `_source: native + VI-level spec_`).
- Roll-up: `READY` (0 gaps) · `NEEDS WORK` (≥1 gap, none fundamental) ·
  `NOT READY` (gaps you judge fundamental). `P% = covered/total`.
- **Focus mode:** when the handoff `scope` targets a single focus Epic, still
  recompute `_coverage.md` VI-holistically (all existing Epics + the re-drafted
  focus Epic) — never a single-Epic view.
- **Refinement mode:** refined targets appear in "Covered by" as `<KEY> (refined)`; net-new drafts as `<slug> (new)`; untouched existing Epics as `<KEY> (exist)`. Requirements no target covers are `❌ gap` rows — the leftover the `epics:` Phase 6.2 gate routes.

## ARD conformance (only when `applicable_ard` is present)

Keep each Epic's scope + acceptance criteria consistent with the VI-level `AD-N`
invariants and `guidance_summary`. When an Epic MUST deviate from an `AD-N`,
record — in that Epic draft, NEVER in the ARD — a line:
`- ARD deviation: [<AD-N id>] — <what deviates> — <why> — flag: architect`
When `applicable_ard` is absent, do nothing here.

## Output

Write Epic files only — **never branch, never commit**. Return:

- `status: DONE | BLOCKED`
- `files_written: [absolute paths of every Epic file written]`
- `coverage_file: <absolute path of _coverage.md>`
- `clarifications_needed: [{epic, section, question, suggested_answer}]`  # empty list when none
- `notes: [dedup notes, any Epic skipped/merged as duplicate, coverage roll-up, requirements_source]`
