description: "Sub-agent for the upgrade: workflow. Handles Phase 2 (execution) for a single component: apply the upgrade plan produced by upgrade-planner, run the build, verify tests via test-baseliner, and auto-fix any test code breakage caused by the new version's API changes. Invoked sequentially by the upgrade orchestrator. NOT triggered by direct user prompts. Leaves all changes uncommitted on the current branch."

# upgrade-executor — Upgrade Execution Sub-agent

Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/upgrade-executor/references/handoff.md` for the exact input/output document format.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/upgrade/references/ecosystems.md` for per-ecosystem update commands.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/test-baseliner/references/handoff.md` for the test-baseliner handoff format.

## Process

Receive one upgrade plan with `status: READY`.

> **Phase resume.** If the input includes `phase: verify-resume`, **skip
> steps 1 and 2** — the changes are already applied and built from the prior
> invocation. Resume at step 3 (Verify). Treat any `baseline` in the input
> as authoritative; do not re-baseline. Default phase (omitted or
> `phase: full`) runs all steps.

1. **Apply changes** — Update every file listed in the plan's `files` array.
   For each related upgrade in `related`, apply those version changes too.
   Use ecosystem-appropriate commands (see `upgrade/references/ecosystems.md`).

2. **Build** — Run the project build (compile only). On failure see "Build failure" below.

3. **Verify** — Invoke `test-baseliner` in `verify` mode, passing the `baseline` from the input handoff.
   - `status: OK` → all green, proceed to step 4.
   - `status: REGRESSIONS` → follow "Test regression" below.
   - `status: RUN_FAILED` → revert all changes, set `status: BUILD_FAILED`.

4. **Output** — Produce the summary record (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/upgrade-executor/references/handoff.md`).

## Build failure

1. Read the full error; attempt one automatic fix (wrong plugin version, incompatible config, removed API).
2. If still failing: revert all changes for this component, set `status: BUILD_FAILED`.

## Test regression

1. Determine whether failures are caused by the upgraded component (API rename, removed annotation, changed behaviour).
2. **Auto-fix** if straightforward: rename imports, update assertion syntax, adjust config. Explain every change in the output.
3. If not auto-fixable, ask the user via `ask_user`:
   > "These tests were passing before the upgrade. Would you like me to:"
   - "Keep the upgrade and leave the failing tests for you to fix"
   - "Revert this upgrade and skip it"
   - "Investigate further before deciding"
4. Honor the choice; record in output.

## Invariants

- Leave all changes **uncommitted** — no git commits, no PRs.
- Process one component per invocation.
- The baseline provided by the orchestrator is authoritative; do not re-run it.

## Model Routing

If the orchestrator passes a `model_routing` block (see
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §4):

- Record it in the output summary record.
- If the block contains `gate_tests_on_review: true` (set by the orchestrator
  for SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK upgrades), **stop after step 2 (Build)** and
  return `status: AWAITING_REVIEW` with the list of files changed and the
  build outcome. **Do NOT run `test-baseliner verify`.** The orchestrator will
  perform an Opus code review, then re-invoke this sub-agent with
  `phase: verify-resume` to run step 3 onward.
- For SIMPLE / MODERATE classification (or no `model_routing` block), proceed
  through all steps as normal.

This sub-agent itself runs under whichever model the orchestrator selected.
For SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK upgrades the orchestrator may still leave this
sub-agent on the current model or Sonnet — Opus is reserved for the planner
and the post-impl review.
