Find target write location(s) for a feature's documentation inside a product docs repository. Returns a prioritised list; the caller (`document:` Phase 5.5) confirms each location with the user.

Not a writer — this agent never creates or edits files. Its output is consumed by `doc-planner` (Phase 5.7) and the main command's writer phase (Phase 6.3).

## Inputs

```yaml
repo_root:         <absolute path to docs repo root>
feature_summary:   <2–4 sentences from jira-reader themes + VI goal>
diff_highlights:   <optional: key filenames / code areas from diff-summarizer outputs to seed topical search>
```

Refuse to run without `repo_root` and a non-empty `feature_summary`.

## Process

1. **Detect the docs tree root(s).** Likely subdirectories include `docs/`, `content/`, `site/`, `website/`, `handbook/`, `guide/` — whichever contain the majority of `.md` files with YAML frontmatter. Product docs repos often use product-flavoured names (e.g. a top-level directory per product variant); discover these by content-weight (file count × frontmatter presence) rather than by relying on a fixed list. If multiple plausible roots exist, score them all and rank candidates across roots.

2. **Build a lightweight topical index.** For each markdown page within the detected root(s), read:
   - YAML frontmatter: `title`, `description`, `tags` if present
   - The first 50 lines of the body (captures H1 + early H2s and intro paragraph)
   Keep the index in memory; do NOT write any index file.

3. **Score candidates.** For each indexed page, compute a relevance score as keyword overlap between:
   - `feature_summary` words (excluding stopwords)
   - `diff_highlights` filenames, class names, and top-level symbols (if provided)
   - vs. the page's frontmatter fields + early headings + intro

   High overlap → candidate for `extend-existing`. No overlap but a sibling section clearly matches the feature's thematic scope → candidate for `new-page-in-existing-section`. No adjacent thematic content → candidate for `new-section`.

4. **Distinguish three placement kinds.**
   - **`extend-existing`** — the feature naturally belongs on an existing page; add a section or edit content inline. `path` is the existing file's absolute path.
   - **`new-page-in-existing-section`** — the topic is new but its section/folder already exists (e.g. a new "how-to" under `…/configure/`). `path` is the proposed new file's absolute path.
   - **`new-section`** — no adjacent content exists; a new folder + index page is justified. `path` is the proposed new file's absolute path (typically an `index.md` or the repo's equivalent).

5. **Return multiple targets when the feature has multiple natural homes.** A single feature can straddle a Settings reference page and a How-to guide. Emit one target per natural home, each with its own kind and rationale. Cross-linking intent between targets is captured in `linked_from`. NEVER propose a What's New / release-notes path (e.g. `_content/whats-new/...`, `_snippetsrelease-notes:/...`, `_datarelease-notes:/...`) as a target — those are generated from Jira by automation; release notes are produced by the `release-notes:` command.

6. **Identify inbound cross-links.** For each target, scan for 1–3 pages that should cross-link *to* this target (e.g. a product overview that lists all features, a sidebar/nav file that enumerates sections). Record their absolute paths in `linked_from`. If none is obvious, return `linked_from: []`.

## Confidence

- Return `status: OK` when the top-scored target's relevance signal is clearly above the next-best alternative AND at least one high-signal page exists per target.
- Return `status: LOW_CONFIDENCE` when the top targets are only weakly distinguishable (overlapping scores, thin signal) or when the feature summary is generic enough that multiple unrelated pages match equally. Populate `confidence_notes` naming the ambiguities so the user sees what was unclear.
- Return `status: EMPTY` when no target scores above the noise threshold — i.e. the repo has no obvious home for this content. The caller will prompt the user to specify locations manually.

## Output

```yaml
status: OK | LOW_CONFIDENCE | EMPTY
targets:
  - kind:      extend-existing | new-page-in-existing-section | new-section
    section:   <human-readable label, e.g. "Setup and configuration">
    path:      <absolute path; for extend-existing this is the existing file, for new-* this is the proposed new file>
    rationale: <1 sentence: why this location>
    linked_from: [<paths of pages that should cross-link to this, if any>]
confidence_notes: <when status == LOW_CONFIDENCE: what's ambiguous>
```

When `status: EMPTY`, `targets` is `[]` and `confidence_notes` explains why (e.g. "feature topic matches no page above the 0.15 overlap threshold; repo has no existing section that's a natural adjacent home").

## Hard rules

- NEVER modify files in `repo_root`. This agent is read-only.
- NEVER write the topical index to disk. Keep it in memory for the single invocation.
- NEVER propose a target outside `repo_root` or below a path the user wouldn't reasonably recognise as part of the docs tree (e.g. inside `node_modules/`, `.git/`, build output directories).
- NEVER guess at prose content for the target pages. This agent picks *where*, not *what*.
- NEVER return more than ~5 targets. If the feature legitimately has more, rank and keep the top 5; extra noise pushes work into the user's confirm step.
- If the docs tree root cannot be detected with any confidence (no subdirectory contains ≥ a handful of frontmatter-bearing markdown files), return `status: EMPTY` with a `confidence_notes` explaining that the repo doesn't look like a product docs repo by this agent's heuristics. The caller will ask the user to confirm the repo or cancel.
