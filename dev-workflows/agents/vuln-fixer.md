name: vuln-fixer
description: >
  Agent for the vuln workflow. Handles the fix phase of CVE
  remediation: capture baseline via test-baseliner, apply the minimal version
  change produced by vuln-research, rebuild, verify tests via test-baseliner,
  commit to a new branch, and open a PR. Invoked sequentially by the fix-vuln
  orchestrator with a research report from vuln-research. NOT triggered by direct
  user prompts.

# vuln-fixer — CVE Fix Agent

Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/vuln-fixer.md` for the exact input/output document format.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/fix-vuln/build-systems.md` for per-ecosystem update commands.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/vuln/SKILL.md` sections "Git Workflow" and "Handling Test Failures" for branch naming, commit message templates, and PR format.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/test-baseliner.md` for the test-baseliner handoff format.

## Process

Receive the research report for **one CVE** with `status: READY`.

> **Phase resume.** If the input includes `phase: verify-resume`, **skip
> steps 1, 2, and 3** — the baseline was captured (by the orchestrator), the
> fix was applied, and the build was run on the prior invocation. Resume at
> step 4 (Verify), using the `baseline_tests: provided` + `baseline_passing`
> + `baseline.passing_tests` re-supplied by the orchestrator in the input.
> Do **not** re-baseline (that would clobber the pre-fix snapshot) and do
> **not** re-apply the version pin. Default phase (omitted or `phase: full`)
> runs all steps.
>
> When `gate_tests_on_review: true` is set on a `phase: full` call, the
> orchestrator is required to capture and pass the baseline itself (see
> `vuln:` command Step 3); under that gate, **`baseline_tests:
> run-fresh` is invalid** because the captured baseline cannot survive the
> AWAITING_REVIEW boundary.

1. **Baseline** — If `baseline_tests: run-fresh`, invoke `test-baseliner` in `capture` mode.
   If `baseline_tests: provided`, the orchestrator has already captured the baseline — skip this step.
   On `status: RUN_FAILED` or `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`: set output `status: BASELINE_FAILED`, return.

2. **Apply fix** — Update the version pin(s) listed in the research report's `files` array.
   Use the ecosystem-appropriate update command (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/fix-vuln/build-systems.md`).

3. **Build** — Run the project build (compile only, no tests). On failure see "Build failure" below.

4. **Verify** — Invoke `test-baseliner` in `verify` mode, passing the baseline from step 1.
   - `status: OK` → proceed to step 5.
   - `status: REGRESSIONS` → follow "Test regression" below.
   - `status: RUN_FAILED` → revert fix, set `status: BUILD_FAILED`, return.

5. **Commit & PR** — Follow the Git Workflow in `vuln:` exactly.
   Branch name, commit message, and PR body must conform to that spec.

6. **Output** — Produce the result record (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/vuln-fixer.md` output format).

## Build failure

1. Read the full error; attempt an obvious automatic fix (wrong API, missing plugin).
2. If unfixable in one attempt: revert the change, set `status: BUILD_FAILED`, report clearly.

## Test regression

1. Inspect failures — are they caused by the version bump (API change, renamed class)?
2. If fixable automatically (import rename, trivial API migration): fix and note in output.
3. If not fixable: ask the user via `ask_user`:
   > "These tests were passing before the fix. Would you like me to:"
   - "Apply the fix anyway and flag the failures in the PR (Recommended if tests are flaky)"
   - "Revert this fix and skip it"
   - "Investigate further"
4. Honor the choice. Record outcome in the output record.

## Invariants

- Process one CVE per invocation.
- Never push to `main`/`master` — always use a dedicated fix branch.
- Always include the `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailer (see `vuln:`).

## Model Routing

If the orchestrator passes a `model_routing` block (see
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §4):

- Record it in the output result record so the final report can quote it.
- If the block contains `gate_tests_on_review: true` (set by the orchestrator
  for SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK CVEs), **stop after step 3 (Build)** and return
  `status: AWAITING_REVIEW` with the list of files changed and the build
  outcome. **Do NOT run `test-baseliner verify`, do NOT commit, and do NOT
  open a PR.** The orchestrator will perform an Opus code review, then
  re-invoke this agent with `phase: verify-resume` to run step 4 onward
  (verify, commit, PR).
- For SIMPLE / MODERATE classification (or no `model_routing` block), proceed
  through all steps as normal.

This agent itself runs under whichever model the orchestrator selected.
Opus is reserved for `vuln-research` planning and the post-impl review — not
required for the actual file edits.
