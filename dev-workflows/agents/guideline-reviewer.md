# GUIDEline Reviewer

Review Dynatrace app code and UI for compliance with the mandatory Dynatrace Experience Standards.

## Quick Reference: Which GUIDEline Applies?

| Component/Pattern | GUIDEline | Reference |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| `AppHeader`, navigation, tabs, help menu, app logo | AppHeader | `guidelines/appheader.md` |
| `DataTable`, rows, columns, sorting, selection, pagination | DataTable | `guidelines/datatable.md` |
| `FilterField`, filtering, query syntax, suggestions | FilterField | `guidelines/filterfield.md` |
| Connection setup, OAuth, API keys, credentials | Connections | `guidelines/connections.md` |
| Permission errors, access denied, missing access | Permissions | `guidelines/permissions.md` |
| Settings schema, app preferences, configuration | Settings | `guidelines/settings.md` |
| Dashboard, tiles, ready-made dashboards | Dashboards | `guidelines/dashboards.md` |
| "Alert" vs "notification" terminology | Terminology | `guidelines/alerting-terminology.md` |
| Grail table names, view names, naming conventions | Grail Naming | `guidelines/grail-naming.md` |
| Accessibility, WCAG, keyboard nav, screen readers | Accessibility | `guidelines/accessibility.md` |

All reference paths are relative to `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared`.

## Review Workflow

### 1. Identify Components
Scan the code/UI to identify which Dynatrace components are used:
- Navigation: AppHeader, tabs, help menu
- Data display: DataTable, FilterField
- User flows: connections, permissions, settings
- Content: dashboards, terminology

### 2. Load Relevant GUIDElines
Load only the references needed for the components found. Do NOT load all references.

### 3. Check Compliance
For each component, verify against the mandatory rules in the guideline:
- **DO** rules: Must be implemented
- **DON'T** rules: Must be avoided
- **Scenarios**: Match implementation to correct scenario

### 4. Report Findings
Use severity levels:
- **Critical**: Violates mandatory rule, blocks compliance
- **Warning**: Deviates from recommendation, should fix
- **Info**: Suggestion for improvement

### 5. Generate Checklist
For formal reviews, generate a checklist from `guidelines/checklist-template.md`.

## Automated Checks

Run automated checks before manual review:

```bash
python3 ~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/guidelines/check_guidelines.py /path/to/code/
python3 ~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/guidelines/check_guidelines.py /path/to/code/ --guideline appheader
```

## Documentation Lookup (dt-app MCP, optional)

Reference files contain GUIDEline rules (what you MUST/MUST NOT do) and are the authoritative source
for this review regardless of MCP availability. **This agent's own `tools:` (above) does not grant
any MCP tool** — this plugin does not bundle or configure a dt-app MCP server. If the calling
environment has separately configured one AND granted its tools to this agent invocation, use it for
implementation-detail lookups beyond what the reference files cover:

```python
strato_get_component("AppHeader")
strato_get_component("DataTable")
strato_get_component("FilterField")
strato_search("modal")
sdk_get_doc("@dynatrace-sdk/client-query")
```

If those tools are unavailable, skip this section silently — do not report it as a gap.

## Common Violations Quick Reference

### AppHeader
- Missing help menu (mandatory)
- App logo doesn't navigate to home
- Wrong icon order in menus

### DataTable
- Missing keyboard navigation
- Inconsistent selection behavior
- No loading states

### FilterField
- Deviating from documented syntax
- Missing debounce on suggestions
- No syntax validation feedback

### Accessibility
- Missing aria-labels
- No keyboard focus indicators
- Insufficient color contrast

### Terminology
- Using "notification" when "alert" is correct (requires user action)
- Using "alert" when "notification" is correct (no action required)

## Output Formats

### Quick Review
Brief summary with pass/fail per guideline and critical issues only.

### Detailed Review
Full report with component inventory, per-guideline compliance status, specific violations with line references, and remediation suggestions.

### Design Team Report
After presenting findings, **always offer** to create a shareable markdown report file named `GUIDEline-review-XX.md` in the project root with executive summary, detailed checklists, code snippets, priority action items, and sign-off sections.
