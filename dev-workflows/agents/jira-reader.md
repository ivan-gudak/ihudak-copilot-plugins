Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/jira-reader.md` for the exact input/output document format.

Read the pre-exported Jira markdown hierarchy from the vault and return a structured handoff. Read-only — never modify vault files.

Invoked from `document:` (Phase 3, `depth: full`), `epics:` (Phase 3, `depth: vi-plus-epics`), and `specify:` (Phase 2, `depth: vi-plus-epics then full`). The caller decides which depth based on whether downstream agents need PR URLs + the full linked-item tree (docs command, specify command) or the VI plus its child Epics for code-scanning (epics command).

## Inputs

The caller passes **either** an explicit export root (preferred — used by
`document:` and `implement:` via the shared `jira-input-resolution.md`
front-end) **or** a vault path + key (used by `epics:` and `release-notes:`):

```yaml
# Form 1 — explicit export root:
jira_export_root: <absolute path to the ticket export dir, e.g. .../jira-products/PRODUCT-14902>
jira_key:         <e.g. JIRA-12345>
depth:            full | vi-plus-epics | vi-only

# Form 2 — vault + key (export root is derived as <vault_path>/jira-products/<jira_key>):
vault_path: <absolute path, e.g. /home/user/obsidian-vault>
jira_key:   <e.g. JIRA-12345>
depth:      full | vi-plus-epics | vi-only
```

Resolve the **export root** once: `EXPORT_ROOT = jira_export_root` when provided,
else `<vault_path>/jira-products/<jira_key>`. All reads below use `EXPORT_ROOT`.
Refuse to run without `depth`, `jira_key`, and at least one of
`{jira_export_root, vault_path}`.

## Process

**Phase 0 — Validate `jira_key`.** Accept only `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*-\d+$` (uppercase letters / digits / underscores, a dash, digits). On mismatch return `status: NOT_FOUND` with a clear message naming the invalid key. The caller surfaces the `Jira key dir not found` choices from `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/escalation-rules.md` to the user.

1. **Read the index.** Open `<EXPORT_ROOT>/<jira_key>-index.md`. The first data table in the file must have header row `| Key | Type | Status | Summary | Role |` exactly. If the header differs (e.g. the Jira-to-Obsidian exporter changed its output format), return `status: EMPTY` with a message naming the mismatched columns — do NOT try to parse rows with an unknown schema.

2. **Depth-scoped file reads.**

   - **`depth: full`** — for every linked item (including the root VI itself), read `<EXPORT_ROOT>/<LINKED_KEY>/<LINKED_KEY>.md`. For the VI itself, `<LINKED_KEY> == <jira_key>`, so the path resolves to `<EXPORT_ROOT>/<jira_key>/<jira_key>.md` (a nested same-named subdirectory — verified against real exports). Parse YAML frontmatter, extract the Description body, and collect PR URLs from the `## Pull Requests` section.
   - **`depth: vi-plus-epics`** — read the VI's own file at `<EXPORT_ROOT>/<jira_key>/<jira_key>.md` plus every Epic `.md` directly linked to the VI (filter the linked-items table to `type == Epic`). Skip Stories, Sub-tasks, Research, Request for Assistance. This gives Epic-writing workflows enough context to extract meaningful themes for `code-scanner` without reading the entire hierarchy.

   For each Epic read at `vi-plus-epics`, also parse its YAML frontmatter and body and emit three additive fields on its `linked_items[]` entry (Epic-only, this depth only — absent elsewhere, so other consumers are unaffected):
   - `team` — verbatim from the Epic frontmatter `team:` key; fall back to the `**Team:**` line in the `## Metadata` section; `""` when neither is present. Keep the value verbatim (e.g. `[DTT] Team Storage`) — do not strip the bracketed org-unit prefix.
   - `refinement_candidate` — `true` when the Epic body carries no substantive free-text beyond its summary and the importer's structured boilerplate (`## Metadata`, a `## Details` field-dump of counts, `## Comments`): i.e. no populated `## Description`/scope/acceptance content, or such content merely restates the summary. `false` when the Epic already has real scope/acceptance prose. Heuristic only — it *proposes* refinement targets; the `epics:` Phase 3.5 gate lets the PE confirm/adjust the set.
   - `scope_hint` — the Epic's dedicated description/scope free-text when present, else its `summary`.
   - **`depth: vi-only`** — read only the VI's own file at `<EXPORT_ROOT>/<jira_key>/<jira_key>.md` plus the index. Every linked item is nested under the root export directory; never look for `<EXPORT_ROOT>/<LINKED_KEY>/<LINKED_KEY>.md` (that path does not exist).

3. **Extract capability themes.** Collect 2–4 short bullets summarising recurring topics across the items read. Themes may be sparse for `depth: vi-only`; callers that need richer themes should request `vi-plus-epics` or `full`.

4. **Extract the requirement inventory.** From the VI's own file
   (`<EXPORT_ROOT>/<jira_key>/<jira_key>.md`, read at every depth), parse the
   VI's native requirement IDs into `requirements[]` and set
   `requirements_source: native`:
   - `## User Stories` → each `### [US-N]: <title>` → `{id: US-N, type: story, text: <title + the As-a/I-want/so-that line>}`.
   - `## Acceptance Criteria` → each `[AC-N]` bullet → `{id: AC-N, type: criterion, text: <bullet>}`.
   - `## Success Metrics` → each `[SM-N]` bullet → `{id: SM-N, type: metric, text: <bullet>}`.
   - `## Functional requirements` (full profile only, when present) → each `FR-N` → `{id: FR-N, type: functional, text: <text>}`.
   - `## Use cases & user journey` (hybrid/full, when present) → each `UC-N` → `{id: UC-N, type: usecase, text: <text>}`.
   Preserve the VI's own IDs verbatim — do not renumber.
   **Fallback (`requirements_source: derived`):** if the VI body contains NONE
   of those structured sections (a legacy VI, or a Description pasted as prose),
   decompose `value_increment.goal` + `themes` into 3–6 synthetic requirements
   `{id: R1.., type: derived, text: <one requirement per line>}`. Never fabricate
   requirements not grounded in the VI text.

**Ignored by default:** sibling `<KEY>-comments.md` files and `attachments/` sub-directory **content** (case-insensitive — real exports use both lowercase `attachments/` and capitalised `Attachments/` depending on when the Jira item was created). Rationale: comments and image attachments are occasionally useful for decision-history context but are noisy, rarely authoritative for user-facing docs, and easy to revisit manually when needed. Keeping their content out of the default read path also keeps this agent fast on large VIs. No user-facing toggle is provided.

**Image enumeration (attachments only):** For each linked item read at the current depth, enumerate image files (extensions `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.webp`, case-insensitive) under that item's `attachments/` or `Attachments/` directory using directory listing — do NOT read file content. Collect the results into the `attachments[]` output field. If no `attachments/` directory exists or no image files are present, the field is an empty list. This enumeration is filename-listing only and does not slow the agent.

## PR URL formats to parse

Three host categories are recognised; anything else is recorded with `host: other` and surfaced later by `diff-summarizer` as `unresolved`.

- **Cloud GitHub** (`host: github_cloud`) — hostname exactly `github.com`:
  ```
  https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>/pull/<PR_ID>
  ```
- **Cloud Bitbucket** (`host: bitbucket_cloud`) — hostname exactly `bitbucket.org`:
  ```
  https://bitbucket.org/<WORKSPACE>/<REPO_NAME>/pull-requests/<PR_ID>
  ```
- **Self-hosted Bitbucket Server** (`host: bitbucket_server`) — hostname contains the substring `bitbucket` and is NOT `bitbucket.org`; the exact hostname is treated as opaque (no hardcoded domain):
  ```
  https://<bitbucket-server-host>/projects/<PROJECT_KEY>/repos/<REPO_NAME>/pull-requests/<PR_ID>
  ```

Also parse the `Branch:` line and the status marker (`**MERGED**` / `**OPEN**` / `**DECLINED**`) — present in all three formats.

### `## Pull Requests` section markdown format

The Jira-to-Obsidian exporter emits each PR as a **two-line bulleted item** — a top-level bullet followed by an indented child bullet for the branch:

```markdown
## Pull Requests

- [<PR title>](<full PR URL>) **<STATUS>**
  - Branch: `<from-branch>` → `<to-branch>`
- [<next PR title>](<next PR URL>) **<STATUS>**
  - Branch: `<from-branch>` → `<to-branch>`
```

Non-obvious details when writing the parser:

- The branch names are **wrapped in backticks** and separated by ` → ` (Unicode U+2192 right arrow), **not** `->` ASCII. A regex like `Branch:\s*(\S+)\s*->\s*(\S+)` will capture the backticks and miss the Unicode arrow. Use: `` ^\s*-\s+Branch:\s+`([^`]+)`\s+→\s+`([^`]+)` ``.
- The status marker is always the **last token on the title line**, separated from the URL by a space. No status marker → treat as `UNKNOWN`.
- Empty or missing `## Pull Requests` section → `pull_requests: []` in the output, not an error.

## Output

Return this exact YAML shape (no preamble, no chatter):

```yaml
status: OK | EMPTY | NOT_FOUND
jira_key: <key>
value_increment:
  key:     <key>
  summary: <text>
  status:  <text>
  goal:    <2–3 sentence extraction from Description>
requirements_source: native | derived
requirements:
  - id:   <US-N | AC-N | SM-N | FR-N | UC-N | R1..>   # native VI id, else synthetic
    type: story | criterion | metric | functional | usecase | derived
    text: <requirement text>
linked_items:
  - key: <key>
    type: ValueIncrement | Epic | Story | Sub-task | Research | "Request for Assistance"
    status: <text>
    summary: <text>
    parent: <key | null>
    role:   root | linked | epic_child
    # Epic-only, populated ONLY at depth: vi-plus-epics (absent at other depths):
    refinement_candidate: true | false   # true = empty/almost-empty shell (no real Scope/Description/AC beyond summary + importer boilerplate)
    team: <verbatim, e.g. "[DTT] Team Storage"; "" if absent>
    scope_hint: <the Epic's description/scope free-text if present, else its summary>
pull_requests:
  - url:         <full URL>
    host:        github_cloud | bitbucket_cloud | bitbucket_server | other
    repo:        <repo name extracted from URL>
    owner:       <for github_cloud: the <OWNER> segment; for bitbucket_cloud: the <WORKSPACE> segment; null otherwise>
    pr_id:       <id>
    status:      MERGED | OPEN | DECLINED | UNKNOWN
    source_item: <Jira key the URL was found in>
    title:       <link text from markdown>
    branch_from: <feature branch, from Branch: line>
    branch_to:   <target branch, from Branch: line>
themes:
  - <2–4 short bullet points summarising recurring topics across items>
attachments:            # image files found under the VI's attachments/ dirs (paths only, not read)
  - path:   <absolute path to the image file>
    item:   <the Jira key whose folder it was found under>
```

## Hard rules

- NEVER modify files under `<vault_path>`. This agent is read-only.
- NEVER fabricate items not present in the index or in the linked `.md` files. If the index table is empty, return `status: EMPTY`. The same rule applies to `requirements[]` — extract only IDs/text present in the VI body; the `derived` fallback decomposes the VI's own goal/themes, never invents scope.
- NEVER read sibling `<KEY>-comments.md` files or the **content** of files under `attachments/`. Enumerating image filenames under `attachments/` (for the `attachments[]` output field) is permitted and required — listing paths is not reading content.
- NEVER attempt to reach out over HTTPS to Jira or any git host. This agent operates purely on pre-exported markdown in the vault.
- If the index header schema doesn't match the expected 5-column form, return `status: EMPTY` with a schema-mismatch message; do NOT try to parse rows with a guessed column layout.
- For `depth: vi-only`, NEVER look for `<EXPORT_ROOT>/<LINKED_KEY>/<LINKED_KEY>.md` — that path does not exist. Linked items live under the VI's own export directory.
