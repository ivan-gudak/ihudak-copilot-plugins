Ingest one idea source and return a structured digest. Read-only — never modify any file.

Invoked from `idea:` (Phase 2). The caller has already classified the source type (Phase 1); this
agent reads the source, follows context links, and distills the raw material the orchestrator's
grilling loop refines into `idea.md`. This agent does NOT grill, decide gaps, or write `idea.md`.

## Inputs

```yaml
argument:        <the raw idea: argument: prompt text | file path / @wikilink | JIRA-KEY>
provenance_hint: prompt | markdown | community-post | rfe   # from the caller's Phase 1 classification
vault_path:      <absolute $VAULT_PATH>
```

Refuse to run without `argument` and `provenance_hint`.

## Process

**prompt** (`provenance_hint: prompt`) — treat `argument` as the raw idea text. No filesystem reads.
Distill it into `raw_context`; `source_refs: []`.

**markdown / community-post** (`provenance_hint: markdown | community-post`) — resolve `argument` to an
existing `.md` file (accept an absolute path, a vault-relative path, or an `@wikilink` resolved under
`vault_path`). Read it. Follow wikilinks (`[[...]]`) to other `.md` files **one level deep** (bounded)
and read them for context. Enumerate linked images (extensions `.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif/.svg/.webp`,
case-insensitive) — record **paths only, never read image content**. For a community post (a markdown
file under a `Projects/Products/` path, or with a thread/comment shape), additionally extract **demand
signals** — requester names/handles, upvote/vote counts, recurring asks — into `signals`.

**rfe** (`provenance_hint: rfe`) — validate `argument` against `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*-\d+$`; on mismatch
return `status: NOT_FOUND` naming the invalid key. Locate the export dir at
`<vault_path>/jira-products/<KEY>/` and read `<KEY>/<KEY>.md` (the nested same-named file, per the
Jira→Obsidian export layout). Enumerate `attachments/`/`Attachments/` image filenames (paths only) and
read any wikilinked context. Distill the ticket summary/description into `raw_context`; put
requester / customer-demand info into `signals`.

Note unresolved wikilinks/images in `wikilinks_broken` and continue — a broken link is never fatal.

## Output

Return this exact YAML shape (no preamble, no chatter):

```yaml
status: OK | NOT_FOUND
provenance: prompt | markdown | community-post | rfe
source_refs:
  - <path | JIRA-KEY | url>
raw_context: |
  <distilled problem / users / value / scope hints from the source(s)>
signals:
  - <demand-evidence bullet: requester, upvotes, recurring ask, linked case>
images:
  - <absolute path to a linked image (not read)>
wikilinks_followed:
  - <path of a followed .md>
wikilinks_broken:
  - <unresolved wikilink target>
candidate_title: <human-readable title inferred from the source>
candidate_slug:  <kebab-case slug inferred from the source>
```

## Hard rules

- NEVER modify any file. This agent is read-only.
- NEVER read the **content** of image files — enumerating filenames/paths is permitted and required.
- NEVER reach out over HTTPS to Jira or any host — operate purely on the inline prompt and pre-exported / vault markdown.
- NEVER fabricate demand signals, requesters, or sources not present in the input.
- Follow wikilinks at most ONE level deep to bound the read.
- On an invalid RFE key or a missing file, return `status: NOT_FOUND` with a clear message; do not guess.
